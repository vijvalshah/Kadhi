## [Unreleased]

## [0.75.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Wire opt-in anonymous hardware-only telemetry behind `KADHI_TELEMETRY=1` with stdlib delivery, `--no-telemetry` flag, command sanitization, and public privacy policy (#318 by @kok-o in #529).

- **Added a ready-made `deepseek-v4-flash-dpo` recipe for deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash
  (#275 by @Srinivasan8888 in #662).** The base already shipped SFT (v0.71.24) and
  GRPO (#279 by @Faisal01011); this completes the trio with the preference shape
  (`task: dpo`, `format: dpo`, `preference_train.jsonl`, `dpo_beta: 0.1`,
  `lr: 5e-6`) over the MoE geometry its SFT sibling already uses (LoRA r16/a32,
  `batch_size: auto`, `gradient_accumulation_steps: 8`, 4-bit, `moe_lora`,
  `moe_aux_loss_coeff`) — deliberately not the GRPO sibling's `1`/`16`, whose
  batch shape is driven by rollout generation that DPO does not do. `lr: 5e-6`
  and `dpo_beta: 0.1` are unanimous across all 12 DPO recipes in the catalog.
  The recipe is not trained — DeepSeek-V4-Flash is MoE — so no hyperparameter
  here is a measured recommendation. Catalog count 163 -> 164.

- **Added a ready-made `kimi-k2.6-dpo` recipe for moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6
  (#275 by @kok-o in #664).** The base already shipped SFT (v0.71.24)
  and GRPO (#614 by @umran666); this completes the trio with the direct preference
  optimization (DPO) shape (`task: dpo`, `preference_train.jsonl`, `dpo_beta: 0.1`,
  `lr: 5e-6`) over the ~1T MoE geometry its siblings already use
  (LoRA r32/a64, `batch_size: 1`, `gradient_accumulation_steps: 16`, 4-bit,
  `moe_lora`, `gradient_checkpointing`, `max_length: 8192`). The recipe is not
  trained — ~1T MoE is multi-node — so no hyperparameter here is a measured
  recommendation. Catalog count 164 -> 165.

- **The MLX backend now drives Kadhi's live terminal dashboard, the `kadhi ui` stream and the experiment tracker
  (#23 by @Srinivasan8888 in #665).** `MLXSFTTrainerWrapper.train()` accepted
  `display` / `tracker` / `run_id` and discarded them, so an MLX run showed
  mlx-lm's raw stdout while the same config on the transformers path got the
  Rich panel. It is an adapter rather than a reuse of `KadhiTrainerCallback` —
  mlx-lm exposes only `on_train_loss_report` / `on_val_loss_report`, so
  bridging through a HuggingFace `TrainerCallback` would have meant faking
  trainer state. `speed` carries `iterations_per_second` to match the
  transformers path's `train_steps_per_second`, because the panel hard-labels
  that field `it/s`; `grad_norm` is deliberately left unset, since mlx-lm does
  not compute one and a field reading a plausible `0.0` on one backend is worse
  than an absent one. Verified against real mlx-lm on an 8 GB M1.

- **Validation loss is now recorded and displayed (#23 by @Srinivasan8888 in
  #713).** Kadhi never stored it on any backend: `KadhiTrainerCallback.on_log`
  read `logs["loss"]` and never `logs["eval_loss"]`, so an evaluation step left
  the last training loss in place and re-reported it to every sink — the
  evaluated number existed nowhere. There was also nowhere to put it: no
  `metrics` column, no `TrainEvent` field, and `TrainingDisplay.update()` reads
  only `grad_norm`, `speed` and `gpu_mem` out of `**kwargs`. The live panel, the
  `metrics` table and the `/api/train/stream` SSE frame now each carry
  `val_loss` as its own series, never folded into `loss`, and the panel gains a
  `Val loss` row. The panel carries the last measured value forward between
  evaluations; the stored and streamed values do **not** — a step where no
  evaluation ran records `NULL`, so a series read back has one point per
  measurement rather than one per logged step. Existing `~/.kadhi/experiments.db` files are
  migrated in place; rows written before this ship read `NULL` rather than a
  fabricated `0.0`, because an unmeasured value must not read as a measured one.
  The MLX producer follows separately.

- **MLX runs now report validation loss (#23 by @Srinivasan8888 in #739).** mlx-lm's `on_val_loss_report` hook was never implemented, so it was called on every evaluation and did nothing — the base-class method is a `pass`, making it a silent no-op rather than an error. It now drives all three sinks #713 added: the live display, the `metrics.val_loss` column, and the `val_loss` field on the SSE stream. The last measured value stays on the panel between evaluations, but only real measurements are written to the database or the wire, so a run records one row per evaluation rather than one per training step. Upstream's `iteration` is recorded as sent, including its off-by-one against the training counter, so a row matches mlx-lm's own log line. A payload without a `val_loss` key writes no row, emits no event, and does not clear an earlier measurement. Verified on Apple Silicon with a real validation split: 9 display updates, 5 database rows and 5 stream events for 5 evaluations.

- **Proved LoRA+ optimizer and scheduler state survive save/resume (#724 by @SID-6921 in
  #747).**
  #738 fixed `training.loraplus_lr_ratio` crashing on the SFT, pretrain and embedding
  wrappers, but its last acceptance criterion — that resuming a LoRA+ run preserves the
  optimizer's momentum and the scheduler's decayed learning rate — was never exercised.
  A new test runs a real 4-step training loop twice against the same seeded base model and
  dataset, once straight through and once interrupted at a real checkpoint and resumed,
  both targeting the same `max_steps`; the optimizer momentum, scheduler LR, and final LoRA
  weights all match exactly between the two. No production code changed: the existing
  `attach_loraplus_optimizer` wiring already handled this correctly, it just wasn't proven.

- **`kadhi doctor --config kadhi.yaml` reports the settings your backend does not read (#755 by @Srinivasan8888 in #756).** A field can be declared, validated and documented and still be read by nothing on the backend you chose — filed one field at a time as #683, #686, #745 and #749 — and `kadhi doctor` could not help, because it read no config at all. It now loads the config and lists only the settings that config actually writes which its task and backend do not read, with the reason and, where one exists, the issue that recorded it; `model_fields_set` separates those from the fields sitting at their schema default. Backend support is declared rather than inferred, because inference does not work: reachability over the import graph detects none of five independently-known MLX gaps, reads of the trainer module alone invent gaps for fields that live in helper modules, and `--dry-run` exits before a trainer is ever constructed. **Scope is deliberately narrow: `task=sft` on `backend=mlx`, seven entries, every one of them a setting `trainer/mlx_sft.py` already warns about at runtime — the value added is that you see it before the run rather than during it, not that it knows anything new.** Five further entries were removed before merge because #734 and #750 wired those fields; the guard shipped here is what caught them. Every other task/backend pair reports nothing rather than guessing. A guard keeps the declared table honest in both directions — an entry marked unread fails once any declared module reads the field, an entry marked read-to-warn fails once the warning is deleted — scanning the trainer **and** the helpers it delegates to, because the fields #734 wired live mostly in `mlx_optim.py`. `kadhi doctor --config` exits 2 when the config cannot be read, so the leg can gate CI.

- **A Turkish README, behind a gate that checks what a translation was synced *from*, not only when (#852 by @Ercaner1988, supersedes #774 and #769).** `README.tr.md` is a full translation of the current `README.md`, linked from a language banner above the logo that lists only languages that exist. `tests/test_readme_translation_sync.py` turns CI red when a translation drifts: every `README.*.md` must carry a `synced-from` stamp matching `sha256(README.md)` over LF-normalised bytes, so CRLF checkouts on Windows agree with Linux and macOS; files are found with a glob, so a new language cannot land unchecked; and each `## ` section must keep `README.md`'s fenced-code languages, external URLs and inline-code spans, in both directions. That last check is what a stamp alone could not do — a different document can carry a valid stamp — and run against the previous draft of the Turkish file it found 29 dropped and 3 invented code references, including two release-note bullets that do not exist in `README.md`. A control suite breaks one thing at a time in a temp tree to prove each lock can fail.

- **`kadhi ingest --source langfuse --pull` fetches generations straight from Langfuse
  (#204 by @Konuktor in #859).** No export step: one row per `GENERATION` observation
  in a `--since` window (default `7d`), read from Langfuse's Observations API v2 —
  `/api/public/traces` leaves Langfuse Cloud on 2026-11-16 — and handed to the existing
  `parse_langfuse`, with chat message lists joined the way it already joins
  `{"messages": [...]}`. Credentials come from `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` /
  `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` (plus `LANGFUSE_HOST` or `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL`), never a flag, and
  stay out of the output, console, debug logs, audit log and error messages. The host is
  HTTPS-only through the same SSRF validator as `--slack-url`, with `--allow-private-host`
  for self-hosted Langfuse; redirects are refused. Every loop is bounded: 30 s per
  request, 64 MiB per response, a `--max-pages` cap (default 100) that exits 1 and writes
  nothing instead of truncating, and 429 retries honouring `Retry-After` up to 60 s.
  Standard-library HTTPS, so no new dependency; without `--pull` nothing changes and the
  pull code is not imported. The hint the local-export path prints named `LANGFUSE_KEY`,
  a variable Langfuse does not read; it now names the key pair. Validated end to end
  against a Langfuse Cloud Hobby project. LangSmith, Helicone, OpenPipe and OpenAI Stored
  Completions stay open on #204.

- **Added the `qwen3.5-0.8b-grpo` and `qwen3.5-2b-grpo` recipes (#848 by @SID-6921 in
  #864).**
  `Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B` and `Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B` previously shipped SFT only; both models are
  small enough that a contributor might actually run a few steps of GRPO reasoning training
  on their own hardware. Learning rate (`1e-5`), LoRA rank (`r=16`/`alpha=32`), and
  `max_length: 4096` follow the existing GRPO templates rather than the SFT siblings'
  values, stated explicitly rather than inherited silently. Catalog count: 165 -> 167.

### Changed

- **The README now leads with `pipx`, and names PEP 668 by its error text (#671 by @swalla02 in #673).**
  `pip install kadhi-cli`, the first command in the README, fails on Debian 12 and
  Ubuntu 23.04 or later:

  ```
  error: externally-managed-environment
  ```

  Those distros ship an `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` marker in the system Python so pip
  refuses to write into a `site-packages` that `apt` also manages
  ([PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/)). It is the default on current
  Debian and Ubuntu, so it is now the ordinary first-run experience on Linux
  rather than an edge case, and nothing in Kadhi can rescue the command: the
  package is not installed yet when the README line runs.

  Kadhi declares a `kadhi` console script, which makes it an application rather
  than a library, so the install now leads with `pipx install kadhi-cli` and
  `uv tool install kadhi-cli`. Both give Kadhi its own virtualenv and put the
  command on `PATH`, which is outside PEP 668's scope entirely. Every existing
  `pip install` line is kept, under a sentence saying when it is the right
  choice: already inside a virtualenv, a Colab notebook, or a Docker image.
  A callout carries the literal `externally-managed-environment` string so the
  error text pasted into a search engine matches Kadhi's own README, and it also
  gives the `python3 -m venv` route for anyone who would rather not add a tool.

  Use `pip` rather than `pipx` if you want to `import kadhi_cli` alongside your
  own code; pipx isolation is the wrong shape for that.

  Documentation only. No packaging or command behaviour changed.

- **Multipack FFD placement is O(N log N) instead of O(N^2) (#694 by @dchaudhari7177 in #726).** Preparing a multipack epoch scanned every open bin for each item; placement now descends a segment tree of per-bin remaining capacity. The packing is unchanged, which is the property that matters — altering which item lands in which bin would silently change every multipack training run — and that was verified at merge against the pre-change function over 6,000 randomized cases with 5,384 of them containing repeated lengths, for zero mismatches. Measured on one box: 5.5x faster at 1,000 rows, 37x at 10,000, and 96x at 30,000, with per-10x-N scaling dropping from 104-130x to 8.9-13.9x. The cap error message no longer describes the algorithm as quadratic, because it no longer is.

- **Sequence-level GSPO objective replaces legacy column-centering (#744 by @kok-o, closes #723).**
  Upgraded `grpo_variant: gspo` from the legacy column-centering heuristic to the
  published Group Sequence Policy Optimization algorithm (Qwen Team, arXiv:2507.18071).
  Because the mathematical objective is replaced at the sequence level, existing
  configurations specifying `grpo_variant: gspo` will yield different numerical losses
  and gradients on upgrade compared to prior versions and will not reproduce prior runs.
  The objective now computes a length-normalized sequence importance ratio
  $s_i = \exp\left(\frac{1}{|y_i|} \sum_{t=1}^{|y_i|} (\log p_\text{new} - \log p_\text{old})\right)$
  and applies sequence-level surrogate clipping with default radius $\varepsilon = 0.2$
  or operator-supplied `grpo_delta`, strictly isolating masked tokens with 0.0 gradient,
  remaining invariant to padding tokens and placement (left vs right), and respecting
  batch permutation invariance.

- **Optimize dataset validator (`kadhi data validate` / `validate_and_stats`) (#771 by @iam-saiteja).**
  Consolidates statistics aggregation into a single pass and replaces string serialization
  with fast hashable row signatures for faster dataset inspection (~1.25x–1.60x speedup).

- **Breaking: an unknown config key now refuses the load (#627 deadline, in #879).**
  v0.74.0 reported every key no config model declares — a typo like `quantizaton`, or a
  field that only exists on a newer Kadhi — as a warning that named v0.75 as the release
  that would start refusing, and `TestTheDeadline` pins that promise to the declared
  version in both directions. This is that release: `kadhi train` exits 1 before the
  training stack is imported, and the API / Web UI loader raises `ValueError` with the
  same text, naming the field you probably meant. Nothing is defaulted or substituted.
  The refusing message says `Refused.` rather than `Not applied.`, which would have read
  as if the run went ahead without the key; the `kadhi sweep` guard, which always refused,
  changes wording the same way. The detector now sees a config the way `KadhiConfig`
  does: a root-level `lora:` block — the LlamaFactory / Axolotl spelling the schema has
  accepted and moved under `training` since v0.40.1 — is remapped through the same
  function before the walk, so a spelling the validator accepts is never one the
  detector refuses (the release review caught the first draft refusing it). Two
  `kadhi fetch examples` files (`llama-3.1-8b-lora`, `qwen2.5-7b-dpo`) used that
  spelling and were moved to the canonical `training.lora`; every recipe, template and
  example config scans clean. Two more findings from the same review ride along: key
  names reached `console.print` unescaped (Rich markup and raw ESC bytes from a YAML
  key could restyle or spoof the terminal — the class six command modules already guard
  privately; the loader now uses the shared `kadhi_cli.utils.terminal.for_terminal`), and
  the scan was unbounded (50,000 bogus keys cost ~31 s of CPU per Web UI request,
  measured; it now stops at 100 findings and says so). The Web UI's `/api/train/start`
  and `/api/config/from-form` return the loader's message — the key and the suggestion —
  instead of a generic "invalid configuration", rendered through the SPA's `escapeHtml()`.
  A config that must stay loadable on v0.74 as well needs the key removed, not renamed.

### Fixed

- Direct AWQ exports now require an explicit, usable calibration JSONL before
  AutoAWQ is imported or the model is loaded, preventing its large default
  calibration dataset from being downloaded silently (#338 by @Faisal01011 in #592).

- **GEMM throughput forecasts now use the card's resolved stream dtype (#617 by @Samearth17 in #648).**
  The pre-flight measurement no longer hard-codes bf16, so pre-Ampere cards are
  benchmarked with the fp16 dtype they actually use. The forecast also reports
  the measured dtype alongside TFLOPS and clock.

- Repaired non-existent Hugging Face repository IDs in MLX catalog recipes
  (#661 by @kok-o in #666). `qwen3-8b-sft-mlx` previously pointed to
  `mlx-community/Qwen3-8B-Instruct-4bit` (which huggingface_hub reports as
  RepositoryNotFoundError); it now references `mlx-community/Qwen3-8B-4bit`.
  `gemma3-9b-sft-mlx` is renamed to `gemma3-4b-sft-mlx` (user-visible rename;
  the old 9B size does not exist upstream) pointing to
  `mlx-community/gemma-3-4b-it-4bit` (size 4B, M1+ 16GB).

- **A non-dict message in a `multimodal` row aborted the whole dataset load instead of
  dropping the row (#670 by @abdulwaarith0).**
  `_convert_multimodal` iterates `row["messages"]` and calls `msg.get("content")` without
  first checking that `msg` is a dict, so a row like `{"messages": ["hello"]}` — a bare
  string, `None`, an int, or a nested list where an object belongs — raised
  `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'`. `format_to_messages` catches
  `KeyError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError` and `ValueError` to route malformed rows to its
  drop path, and `AttributeError` is in none of them, so the exception escaped the
  converter and killed the run: one bad line in a large JSONL file took the entire dataset
  with it rather than being skipped like every other malformed row. The converter already
  guarded the *parts* inside a message (`multimodal content part must be a dict`) but not
  the message itself. It now raises `ValueError` for a non-dict message, which the existing
  drop path already understands, so such rows are dropped and the rest of the dataset
  loads. Valid rows are unaffected: typed content-part lists and the plain-string
  back-compat path both convert exactly as before.

- `kadhi migrate` no longer refuses a valid competitor config just because the file
  is named `*.jsonl`. The guard branched on the filename alone; the content sniff
  written to gate it, `_looks_like_jsonl()`, had no call site, so a YAML config
  saved as `config.jsonl` exited 2 with "got JSONL" and could not be migrated at
  all. Both conditions are now required, which leaves `.ipynb` notebooks (which
  legitimately start with `{`) untouched. The N2 test now drives the command
  through `CliRunner` rather than calling the helper, so the wiring is what is
  actually asserted (#675 by @swalla02, closes #672).
  The sniff also reads `utf-8-sig` rather than `utf-8`, so a UTF-8 BOM (which
  Windows tooling writes by default) cannot defeat it, and its read is bounded
  so a file with no newline is not pulled into memory entire.

- **chatml / audio / video converters silently kept a non-dict message instead of
  dropping the row (#676 by @BetterAndBetterII in #678).**
  `format_to_messages` documents a drop contract: a malformed row returns `None`
  so one bad JSONL line is skipped rather than corrupting the dataset.
  `_convert_chatml`, `_convert_audio` and `_convert_video` passed a non-dict
  `messages` element through verbatim, so `{"messages": ["hello"]}` — or `42`,
  a nested list, or `None` where a message object belongs — survived into
  training. `chatml` is what `detect_format` returns for a bare
  `{"messages": [...]}` row, so this was the default path for the most common
  dataset shape. Each converter now raises `ValueError` for a non-dict message,
  which the existing drop path already understands. The list-type guard from
  @v01dst in #679 also rejects empty non-list values such as `""` and `{}`;
  regression tests pin both shapes. Video rows with missing or null `messages`
  still normalize to an empty list. The shared conversion-based validator
  from #712 uses these guards too, so `kadhi data validate` and `load_dataset`
  agree on which rows are dropped. Valid rows convert exactly as before.

- **MLX SFT ignored `training.gradient_accumulation_steps` (#684 by @AmirF194 in #696).** The wrapper built
  mlx-lm's `TrainingArgs` without a `grad_accumulation_steps` kwarg, so mlx-lm's own
  dataclass default of 1 always applied regardless of the configured value, silently
  changing the effective batch size and optimizer-update cadence on every MLX run. The
  written `adapter_config.json` also hardcoded `grad_accumulation_steps: 1`, so the drift
  could not be detected from the output afterwards either. Both now carry the value
  `training.gradient_accumulation_steps` actually resolves to. `iters` is also rounded
  down to a whole number of accumulation groups (kept at a minimum of one group), because
  mlx-lm only updates the optimizer on `it % accum == 0` and never flushes a trailing
  partial group; without this a dataset smaller than the accumulation window trained for
  zero optimizer updates.

  **Anyone who never touched this field will see a different effective batch size after
  upgrading.** `gradient_accumulation_steps` defaults to 4, so an MLX run that used to
  update on every micro-batch now accumulates over 4 before updating: a 4x larger
  effective batch size and roughly a quarter as many optimizer updates for the same
  `iters`. This is the correct value for the schema default; a differently-converging run
  after this upgrade is expected, not a regression.

- **MLX SFT ignored `training.gradient_checkpointing` (#685 by @AmirF194 in #698).** The wrapper built
  mlx-lm's `TrainingArgs` without a `grad_checkpoint` kwarg, so mlx-lm's own dataclass
  default of `False` always applied regardless of the configured value, silently giving up
  the memory savings a user enabled checkpointing for. The written `adapter_config.json`
  also hardcoded `grad_checkpoint: false`, so the drift could not be detected from the
  output afterwards either. `gradient_checkpointing` accepts a bool or one of the
  `selective`/`medium`/`full`/`auto` tiers; mlx-lm has only a single on/off switch, so any
  non-`False` tier now resolves to `True` there, the same `bool()` coercion already used
  for this field on the other trainer backends. A tier value now also prints the same
  `MLX backend ignores: ...` advisory this file already uses for other flattened options,
  since the granularity itself is silently dropped even though checkpointing is enabled.

- `data.interleave`'s `over`/`probs` strategies could place the same row (a source's original plus its `over`/`probs`-padded copy) in both `train` and `val`; `val_split` now runs before the padding, per source, on the eager local-file and HF-hub interleave paths (the streaming path is unaffected and still has this leak). The requested `val_split` fraction is no longer exact on those two paths under `over`/`probs`, since it is now taken from each source's smaller, unpadded row count; `concat`/`under` are unaffected either way. See `docs/data.md`'s interleave section for the numbers (#680 by @AmirF194 in #701).

- **The MLX SFT benchmark harness now exercises the display/tracker bridge
  (#703 by @Shutaru; Refs #23).** It passes a real Rich display and an artifact-local SQLite
  tracker to the MLX wrapper, and rejects runs without display updates or
  recorded metrics. Training stays inside the stdout tee so whole-run
  throughput still comes from mlx-lm's trained-token counter, with ANSI controls
  and wrapped whitespace normalised before parsing the final report. Regression
  tests cover the wiring, terminal output, failure/interruption cleanup, and
  disconnected telemetry. The stdout tee preserves terminal detection so the
  Rich panel can refresh during an interactive run; all terminal widths from
  20 to 200 are exercised by the regression test. The existing Apple Silicon
  measurements are unchanged; a new hardware run with the bridge enabled remains outstanding.

- **`wasserstein`/`topk_align` cross-tokenizer distillation trained on logits the teacher
  computed for the wrong text, with no visible failure (#704 by @AmirF194, closes #681).**
  Both strategies forwarded the student's own `input_ids` straight to the teacher, clamped
  into its vocab range to avoid an index error. Clamping does not translate tokens between
  vocabularies, so a mismatched pair silently fed the teacher garbled or wrong text while
  still reporting a finite, plausible-looking loss. `wasserstein`/`topk_align` now refuse a
  tokenizer pair that isn't interchangeable at `setup()`, naming `wasserstein_aligned` (which
  already re-tokenizes correctly) as the working alternative for genuinely different
  tokenizers. The same-tokenizer fast path (e.g. two sizes in one family) is unaffected.

- Fixed `ValueError: Lora rank r must be > 0` when training embeddings with
  `lora.r: 0` (full fine-tuning) on `task: embedding` (#700 by @kok-o in #705).
  `_setup_transformers()` now skips PEFT wrapping when `r == 0`, and
  `_EmbeddingTrainer` delegates `model` and `args` attributes.

- Prevented training subprocess hang in Web UI when no client drains stdout
  (#688 by @kok-o in #706). Output is now continuously consumed by a background
  thread into a bounded ring buffer, allowing training to proceed regardless of
  subscriber state and supporting multi-subscriber replay via `Last-Event-ID`.

- Required authentication on Web UI read endpoints and SSE streams
  (#687 by @kok-o in #707). Run configurations, logs, and system metrics now
  require Bearer authorization. SSE endpoints authenticate via short-lived,
  single-use tickets exchanged over an authenticated POST, avoiding durable
  tokens in query strings. Non-loopback binding requires a valid authentication
  token and is rejected with exit code 2 if missing or invalid.

- **`task: embedding` on the transformers backend no longer crashes after setup (#708 by @jagadeepmamidi, closes #690).** `_EmbeddingTrainer` already delegated `train` / `save_model` / `add_callback` / `state` but not `model` or `args`, which `train()` reads for fp16 dtype alignment.

- **SFT and pretrain `packing: true` no longer raise `TypeError` on TRL 0.29 (#709 by @jagadeepmamidi, closes #691).** `packing` is an `SFTConfig` field; passing it as an `SFTTrainer` kwarg is rejected because `__init__` has no `**kwargs`. Kadhi now carries it through `_as_sft_config` on both trainers. `packing_cross_doc_attn_mask` is schema-rejected: it never mapped to a valid TRL `packing_strategy` (allowlist is `bfd` / `bfd-requeue` / `wrapped`). Use `packing: true` with FlashAttention instead.

- **`data.streaming` is honoured for a single HuggingFace Hub dataset name (#710 by @jagadeepmamidi, Refs #689).** `_load_one_hub_dataset` now forwards `streaming=True` (and `buffer_size` shuffle) to `datasets.load_dataset`, then materialises up to `MAX_REMOTE_ROWS`. Previously the flag was ignored and the full dataset was materialised; a Hub source over 1,000,000 rows is now cut to 1M with a warning. An all-hub interleave list with streaming stays schema-rejected.

- The ULD distillation loss (`wasserstein` / `topk_align` / `wasserstein_aligned`)
  ignored the response-only label mask and the causal shift the CE term already
  applies, so under the default `train_on_responses_only` it optimized prompt
  tokens and the shift-boundary position too (#711 by @AmirF194, closes
  #682). `uld_distill_loss` and `uld_aligned_loss` now take an optional
  `labels` argument and mask on `labels != -100` after the same shift
  `_compute_distill_term` uses.

- **`kadhi data validate` green-lit rows that `load_dataset` then drops, because the
  validator never ran the converters (#712 by @abdulwaarith0).**
  `validate_and_stats` judged a row by top-level key presence against `FORMAT_SIGNATURES`,
  while the loader runs `format_to_messages` and drops any row that returns `None`. Those
  are different notions of "valid", so they disagreed two ways: the six formats absent from
  `FORMAT_SIGNATURES` (`prm`, `pre_tokenized`, `input_output`, `video`, `multimodal`,
  `raft`) skipped validation entirely and reported every row valid regardless of content,
  and for the formats that were checked, key presence passed rows a converter drops on a
  value — a null field, a non-dict message. `kadhi data validate` could report a file fully
  valid that the loader could not load, moving the failure from validate time into the
  middle of a training run. `valid_rows` is now computed by running the real conversion
  path per row, so agreement is structural rather than a second, weaker check that drifts;
  every format is covered, including the six that were skipped. When a row is dropped, the
  converter's own reason is surfaced for the first few offenders (`row 3: chatml message
  must be a dict`) so the report says which rows and why, not only a count. Exit-code
  behaviour is unchanged: `validate` still exits 0 even at `0/N`, so the `kadhi ci init`
  gate is unaffected; whether a `0/N` file should fail the gate is left to a separate
  change. On the repo's own datasets this shifts 120 of 360 file-by-format verdicts, every
  one an over-count on a file that genuinely has zero valid rows in that format, with no
  exit code moved.

- #651: Raise the minimum supported PyTorch version to 2.6.0 because TRL 0.29 preference trainers require the public FSDP2 API. (#651 by @Samearth17 in #717)

- **MLX SFT now honours `data.train_on_responses_only` (#683 by @Srinivasan8888 in #733).** The option defaults to `true` and reached nothing on the MLX path: no mask was passed to mlx-lm's dataset constructor, so every MLX SFT run trained on system and user turns against the documented default, and adapter metadata recorded `mask_prompt: false` regardless. Setting upstream's flag is not the fix — `ChatDataset` masks a single prefix ending before the last message, so on multi-turn chat it supervises only the final assistant turn. Measured on Apple Silicon over 16 two-turn conversations: 772 supervised tokens before, 71 with upstream's flag, 146 with a correct mask. Chat rows now use a Kadhi per-token mask injected through `train(loss=..., iterate_batches=...)`; prompt/completion rows use upstream's flag, which is correct for that shape; plain-text rows warn instead, because upstream raises when the flag is set on them. Non-prefix-stable chat templates, conversations with no assistant content, and conversations opening on an assistant turn are refused explicitly rather than approximated. This does not make the two backends comparable: MLX now excludes the assistant header from the loss and refuses templates it cannot align, while the transformers path supervises the header and, on thinking-style templates such as Qwen3's, supervises a user-turn fragment. MLX is the stricter of the two; the transformers behaviour is filed separately. A template MLX cannot mask -- Qwen3's, which injects its thinking block only for the last assistant turn -- is now refused at dataset construction, before the training loop starts, with a message naming `data.train_on_responses_only: false` as the remedy. **One shipped recipe is affected.** `qwen3-8b-sft-mlx` does not set `data.train_on_responses_only`, so it takes the `true` default: measured against the real `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` tokenizer, single-turn and system+single-turn rows train (8 supervised tokens, the thinking block included), and **multi-turn rows now refuse** where they previously trained on the prompt. Set `data.train_on_responses_only: false` to restore the old behaviour on multi-turn Qwen3 data. The other two MLX recipes are unaffected: `llama3.1-8b-sft-mlx` and `gemma3-4b-sft-mlx` mask correctly on both shapes, verified against `mlx-community/gemma-3-4b-it-4bit` itself.

- **MLX SFT now honours `warmup_ratio`, `scheduler`, `weight_decay` and `optimizer` (#686 by @Srinivasan8888 in #734).** The backend built `AdamW(learning_rate=<scalar>)` and nothing else, so all four were validated, accepted and dropped without a warning — an MLX run silently trained a different recipe from the configured one, and only 8 of the 32 names on Kadhi's optimizer allowlist have an MLX equivalent while all 32 became AdamW. Schedules are now composed from `mlx.optimizers` in **optimizer-update** units (`iters // gradient_accumulation_steps`), which is what MLX drives a callable learning rate from; building against iterations would stretch the warmup by the accumulation factor and never reach the cosine floor. Measured on Apple Silicon, a `cosine` run with `warmup_ratio=0.2` now reports 10 distinct learning rates across 40 iterations where the old path reported one. Unsupported optimizer and scheduler names are refused by name rather than silently becoming AdamW, weight decay on an optimizer that cannot take it is refused rather than dropped, a `warmup_ratio` that rounds to zero updates says so, and adapter metadata records the effective optimizer and schedule.

- `grpo_variant: gspo` centered the per-token log-ratio across the batch
  before the completion mask was applied, so a masked (padding) token
  shifted the loss and gradient of every unmasked row sharing its column,
  and picked up a non-zero gradient of its own (#735 by @AmirF194, refs
  #723). The batch-mean statistic is now taken over unmasked positions
  only.

- PPO now forwards `training.epochs` and `ppo_kl_penalty` to TRL 0.29's
  `num_train_epochs` and `kl_coef` fields while retaining legacy field-name
  compatibility (#721 by @be-student in #737).

- **`training.loraplus_lr_ratio` crashed every affected run instead of enabling LoRA+
  (#738 by @abdulwaarith0).**
  The SFT, pretrain and embedding wrappers inserted `loraplus_lr_ratio` into
  `training_kwargs` and forwarded it to `TrainingArguments(**training_kwargs)`. It is not a
  `TrainingArguments` field — it belongs to PEFT's optimizer construction — so an advertised,
  schema-accepted option raised `TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument
  'loraplus_lr_ratio'` before the first training step. It is now routed through a shared
  `attach_loraplus_optimizer` helper that builds a `create_loraplus_optimizer` optimizer (LoRA
  B matrices at `lr × ratio`, A at `lr`) and assigns it to `trainer.optimizer` after the
  trainer is built — respected because `Trainer.create_optimizer` only builds one when
  `self.optimizer is None`, with the scheduler still built from it using the configured
  warmup/schedule. The optimizer class and its betas/eps come from the run's configured
  optimizer via `Trainer.get_optimizer_cls_and_kwargs`, so LoRA+ uses the optimizer the user
  asked for, and weight decay is applied through PEFT's own `loraplus_weight_decay`. The
  combination with GaLore is now rejected with a clear message rather than silently overriding
  the GaLore optimizer, and `loraplus_lr_ratio` on a non-LoRA run is rejected instead of
  silently doing nothing.

- **MLX SFT now honours `training.max_grad_norm` (#749 by @Srinivasan8888 in #750).** The field is forwarded into `TrainingArguments` by sixteen transformers trainers, so the documented default clips every transformers run at 1.0 — and on `backend: mlx` it reached nothing: no MLX file read it, `mlx_lm`'s `TrainingArgs` has no such field and its trainer clips nowhere, and the `MLX backend ignores:` line did not mention it. The same config therefore trained clipped on one backend and unclipped on the other, silently. Gradients are now clipped through `mlx.optimizers.clip_grad_norm` by an optimizer that clips before delegating, which reaches mlx-lm's single `optimizer.update(model, grad)` call site without forking its training loop; `optimizer.state` and `optimizer.learning_rate` still delegate, because upstream reads both off the object it is handed. The norm that ran is recorded in `adapter_config.json`. Measured on an M1 inside upstream's own compiled-step shape, one step on an ill-conditioned batch moved SGD weights by 388.03 unclipped versus 0.0085 at `max_grad_norm: 1.0`; AdamW moves 0.126505 versus 0.126504, because Adam normalises by its second moment — so this rescues `optimizer: sgd` / `lion` and gradient spikes rather than every MLX run.

- **`kadhi eval auto` no longer dies with a `TypeError` after a successful eval (#752 by @Srinivasan8888 in #754).** Typer fills a command's parameters only when typer invokes it; called as a plain Python function, an unpassed parameter keeps its literal `typer.models.OptionInfo` default, which is truthy. `auto()` passed three of `custom()`'s five typer parameters, so `output` and `attach_to_registry` arrived as `OptionInfo`: the `--output`/`--attach-to-registry` block fired on every run though neither was requested, `output or "eval_results.json"` evaluated to the `OptionInfo` rather than the filename, and `write_eval_json` raised `TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not OptionInfo` — uncaught, after the eval had already run and saved its results to the tracker. The same call in `monitoring/callback.py` is wrapped in `except Exception`, so mid-training auto-eval with `eval.custom_tasks` configured reported `Auto-eval custom failed: ... not OptionInfo` instead. Both call sites now pass every typer parameter, and a guard fails the suite when any bare-name call to a typer command leaves one unfilled — resolving each callee to a declaration in the calling module or a `from X import name`, rather than by bare name, which had merged every `main()` in the tree and flagged `autodistill/mlx_worker.py`'s argparse entry point with fifteen options it does not declare.

- **Inference prompts are now encoded the way Kadhi trains them (#781 by @Konuktor in #782).**
  `kadhi chat`, `kadhi serve` (transformers backend and `--mole`), `kadhi infer` /
  `kadhi bench`, `kadhi diff`, the `live_eval` generators behind the eval gate,
  `kadhi ship`, `kadhi diagnose` and `kadhi advise`, and `kadhi data generate`'s local
  provider rendered the chat template to text and then let the tokenizer add its
  own special tokens, so templates that render `{{ bos_token }}` (Llama-3, Gemma,
  Mistral) sent a doubled BOS while Kadhi's default SFT path trains with one. A
  rendered prompt is now encoded with no tokenizer special tokens, matching training
  and `apply_chat_template(tokenize=True)`: 2 → 1 BOS on vendor templates, 1 → 0 on
  Kadhi's `data.chat_template` presets (which render none), and no trailing EOS from
  tokenizers that append one; `usage.prompt_tokens` drops accordingly. Models without
  a chat template, and templates that fail to render, are encoded exactly as before.
  Adapters trained with `train_on_responses_only: false` saw the doubled BOS in
  training and now differ from inference by one token; that path and the vLLM /
  SGLang / MII engines are tracked in #781.

- Fixed `kadhi doctor` treating the optional `[train]` stack as missing required dependencies: a core-only install now suggests `pip install "kadhi-cli[train]"` once (with the CUDA wheel index on NVIDIA GPUs) instead of bare per-package floors, `kadhi version --full` derives installed extras from distribution metadata, and a missing or incompatible core dependency exits non-zero (#828 by @wangzhengzhuo05 in #854).

- Make `kadhi data validate` fail when no rows are usable, and add an optional
  minimum-valid-fraction threshold for stricter CI gates (#811 by @akkupratap323 in #858).

- Route terminal charts through Rich so `NO_COLOR` and redirected output contain no raw
  ANSI escapes while interactive charts retain colour (#824 by @akkupratap323 in #860).

- **`kadhi data validate --format` accepted any string and reported every row valid for it
  (#866 by @SID-6921 in #869).**
  `commands/data.py` declared `fmt: str` with help text listing the real formats but never
  checked the value against `kadhi_cli.data.formats.VALID_FORMATS` before `validate_and_stats`
  ran, so `--format bogus` exited 0 and reported "2/2 rows valid for bogus format". Since
  `kadhi data validate` is the first step of the PR gate `kadhi ci init` writes, a typo'd
  `--format` in a CI workflow silently turned the gate into a pass for any file — the same
  class of silent pass #811 and #858 just closed for "0 usable rows". An unknown format now
  exits 1 (input error), not the failed-gate exit code 2.

### Security

- **`kadhi ui --public` no longer serves the FastAPI docs to the LAN (#731 by @Srinivasan8888 in #732).** `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, `/docs/oauth2-redirect` and `/redoc` answered 200 without a token on a non-loopback bind, so anyone on the network could enumerate every route, parameter and request/response shape. No run data, configuration or logs were exposed — every endpoint the schema describes already answered 401 after #707 — so this was reconnaissance rather than disclosure, and it predates #707. The four routes are now absent (404) on a non-loopback bind and unchanged on loopback. They are removed rather than gated because `/docs` is a browser navigation that cannot carry a Bearer header, so gating would have broken the page for developers while leaving `/openapi.json` readable by any HTTP client.

## [0.74.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- **`kadhi eval aider` runs Aider's Polyglot code-editing benchmark through its
  official Docker harness (#91 by @Amix29 in #482).** The command preflights
  Docker, the daemon, and the locally built benchmark image; mounts a prepared
  Polyglot corpus read-only; keeps output under cwd; and aggregates bounded per-exercise JSON
  into a Kadhi result row. `--run-id` records the score in `eval_results` for the
  existing run comparison workflow. The optional `[aider]` extra installs the
  normal Aider CLI while the docs make the source-only benchmark-image setup
  explicit.
- **Native Apple Silicon telemetry for `kadhi monitor` (#99 by @Amix29 in #481).**
  The monitor now reads bounded plist output from macOS `powermetrics` and
  renders GPU utilization and power in the existing Rich table. It reuses an
  explicitly cached sudo credential through non-interactive `sudo -n`, never
  reads a password, and gives an actionable Activity Monitor fallback when
  permission or telemetry is unavailable. NVIDIA-only VRAM, memory-utilization,
  and temperature fields remain unavailable rather than being guessed.
- **`kadhi mcp serve` gains network transports: `--transport sse` and
  `--transport http` (#296 in #479).** v1 was stdio-only, which suits a client that
  spawns Kadhi as a subprocess but leaves remote and multi-client setups with
  nothing. Both new transports serve the *same* registry — the end-to-end test
  compares the advertised tool names against `build_registry` rather than a
  hardcoded count, so a subset cannot creep in. stdio remains the default and
  is untouched.

  Adding a listener is the risky part, so it is gated three ways. Every HTTP
  request needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, compared with
  `secrets.compare_digest`, with no opt-out — a loopback port is reachable by
  every process on the box. The token is validated by the existing
  `utils/qr_url.py::validate_token`, so `kadhi ui` and `kadhi mcp serve` agree on
  what a token is instead of growing a second format, and it travels in the
  header only: no query-string fallback that could land in an access log. The
  SDK's DNS-rebinding protection is switched on (`421` on a foreign `Host`,
  `403` on a foreign `Origin`), which is the gate the token cannot be — a page
  the operator merely visits sends no `Authorization` header but its request
  still reaches the port. Binding off loopback warns, and a wildcard bind warns
  again that the Host check has nothing left to pin.

  `--allow-execute` is refused with either network transport, and that refusal
  is the one behavioural change to an existing flag. Gated execution (#297)
  spawns real training / export processes; behind a listener a leaked Bearer
  token would mean process execution rather than plan disclosure, and stdio is
  a pipe to a client the operator already started, which is a different trust
  boundary. The refusal is made twice on purpose: once in the CLI so the
  operator gets a readable message, and once in `build_asgi_app()` so a direct
  caller cannot put an executing registry behind a listener either. The stdio
  banner also stopped claiming "execution disabled" -- that string predated
  #297 and was false from the moment execution shipped.

  `--host` / `--port` / `--auth-token` are refused under `--transport stdio`
  rather than silently ignored, and the ASGI app is built by a
  `build_asgi_app()` factory so the auth and rebinding behaviour is tested
  through an in-process transport without binding a socket; one further test
  binds a real ephemeral port and drives initialize -> list_tools -> call_tool
  through the SDK's own SSE client.

  The `[mcp]` extra floor moves `1.2.0` -> `1.10.0`, measured against the
  published wheels rather than a changelog: `server/streamable_http_manager.py`
  first appears in 1.8.0 (absent in 1.7.0) and `server/transport_security.py`
  in 1.10.0 (absent in 1.9.4). `--transport sse` alone would have run on the
  old floor; rebinding protection would not, and a listener whose origin
  checking silently disappears on an older SDK is worse than a resolver error.
  The `<2` cap is unchanged — #322 is the 2.x migration. No new package: `mcp`
  already requires starlette, uvicorn, sse-starlette and httpx-sse.

- **`kadhi data best-of-n` can sample candidates from Ollama or vLLM providers
  (#299 by @Faisal01011 in #466).** The existing local Transformers `--base` path stays
  the default, while `--provider ollama|vllm --model <m> [--base-url <url>]`
  draws each prompt's N candidates through the existing SSRF-validated raw-
  completion seam. Provider and model are recorded in `_best_of_n` provenance;
  Anthropic is refused by name because its Messages API has no raw-completion
  endpoint, and local-only flags cannot be silently ignored in provider mode.

- **Baseline artifacts carry a scorer/version provenance stamp (#404 by @AchuthReddy-16 in #485).**
  Shared helpers `stamp_baseline_scores` / `write_baseline_file` write
  `{"scores": {...}, "provenance": {"kadhi_version", "scorer_revision"}}`.
  `kadhi eval gate --write-baseline <path>` is the user-facing producer.
  `resolve_baseline` warns once on unknown provenance (unstamped files) or a
  `scorer_revision` mismatch, and stays silent when the stamp matches.
  `BUNDLED_SCORER_REVISION` + a locked fingerprint fail the suite if a bundled
  scorer's output moves without a revision bump. Registry `save_eval_result`
  stamps `details_json`; `kadhi ship --emit-evidence` includes the same stamp.

- **Layer streaming now accepts Qwen3.5 MoE text checkpoints whose decoder
  layers do not expose exactly the same weight keys in every block (by
  @Shutaru in #426).** The sharder now records per-layer shard headers instead of
  deriving the pool from layer 0 alone, while still refusing divergent storage
  layouts for any shared key and rebuilding NF4 `Params4bit` views from
  validated per-weight metadata. `qwen3_5_moe` / `qwen3_5_moe_text` route
  through the existing qwen3 streamer. A heterogeneous toy MoE is bit-exact
  streamed versus resident on CPU; live validation was also run on
  `Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B` with layer streaming, NF4, MoE LoRA target resolution
  and a 3072-token SFT dataset. `stream_layers` now refuses
  `moe_expert_quant`, which is applied only by the resident setup path and was
  otherwise silently ignored.

- **`live_eval.load_model_and_tokenizer` gains a `quantization` parameter; no live evaluation
  path sets it yet (#367 by @AmirF194 in #461).**
  `quantization="4bit"` builds the same nf4 `BitsAndBytesConfig` every other 4-bit load path
  in this codebase uses (`"8bit"` and the unset default are also supported), and the four
  internal callers this helper has (`make_generator`, `make_multi_generator`, `lora_probe`,
  `measure_logit_agreement`) still call it with no `quantization`, so today an NF4-trained
  adapter is still judged against a bf16 base it never saw during training. The follow-up is
  wiring those four callers to a default derived from the run's own configuration (`kadhi ship
  --config`, the registry entry, or the adapter's `adapter_config.json`), per the issue's own
  Fix path; that plus `kadhi ship` reporting the numerics it judged with and a staleness gate
  on mismatched-numerics evidence are left open (issue acceptance criteria 2 and 4).

- **`training.stream_pin` makes layer-streaming pinning configurable (#366 by @ousamabenyounes in #416).**
  Page-locking the RAM store is chosen automatically by `decide_pinning`, and
  until now nothing could override it — so while #331 was live, `pin=False` was
  the only known mitigation for silently wrong NF4 gradients yet was unreachable
  from `kadhi.yaml`. `stream_pin: false` now forces the pageable store (and the
  pre-flight states the throughput it costs, up to 6.56x measured, rather than
  absorbing it silently); `stream_pin: true` forces the pinned store and, **on
  the RAM tier**, refuses the run — naming the store size, not the ceiling
  (#366 AC3): `pinned_limit_bytes` is passed as `None`, so the page-lock ceiling
  is deliberately left unprobed and the store size is the only figure the
  refusal can honestly cite — if the box cannot page-lock it, instead of
  degrading silently; unset keeps today's automatic behaviour. On the disk tier
  (no RAM store to page-lock) and on CPU (no device to copy to) pinning is
  *inapplicable* rather than unsatisfiable, so `true` is **announced and the run
  proceeds** — refusing there would brick the large-model runs the disk tier
  exists for, and would make the key uncommittable to a config shared between a
  GPU box and a CPU box. Set while `stream_layers: false` it is rejected as a
  footgun, like the other stream keys.

- **A ready-made `qwen3.5-9b-grpo` recipe for GRPO reasoning training with `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` (#277 by @harshitthek in #448).**
  The recipe combines the established GRPO defaults (accuracy reward, beta=0.1, 4 generations)
  with LoRA r=16 and 4-bit quantization.

- **A ready-made `glm-5.1-dpo` recipe for DPO preference training with `zai-org/GLM-5.1` (#280 by @Osheun in #452).**
  The first recipe pairing DPO with a MoE base, so it carries `moe_lora: true`
  alongside the established DPO defaults (beta=0.1, LoRA r=32 / alpha=64, 4-bit
  quantization). `epochs: 1` and `max_length: 8192` are taken from the SFT
  sibling rather than the smaller qwen defaults, which suit a 754B MoE better.

- **Cross-tokenizer draft support for `kadhi draft` and `kadhi serve` (#304 by @CODING-DARSH in #417).**
  - `kadhi draft distill` now accepts target/draft pairs with mismatched tokenizers or vocabularies, automatically routing through `uld_strategy: wasserstein_aligned` (Universal Logit Distillation) instead of refusing the pair.
  - `kadhi draft measure` supports cross-tokenizer acceptance measurement using decoded character-span alignment (`count_accepted_spans`) across different vocabularies and token boundaries. Target generation neutralizes only `repetition_penalty` with `repetition_penalty=1.0` (Refs #345) so target greedy argmax and draft raw-logit scoring are evaluated consistently; remaining generation processors (`no_repeat_ngram_size`, `encoder_repetition_penalty`, `min_new_tokens`, `bad_words_ids`, `suppress_tokens`, and `sequence_bias`) are not altered.
  - `kadhi serve --speculative-decoding` supports cross-tokenizer draft serving via Transformers Universal Assisted Decoding (UAD) when supported by the installed `transformers` version, raising a clear error if unsupported.
  - Compatible same-tokenizer pairs strictly preserve the existing native fast path.
- **`data.interleave` is now wired into training-time dataset loading (#443 by @blackcoderx in #460).**
  `parse_interleave`/`InterleaveSpec` have been schema-validated and unit-tested since
  v0.42.0, but `load_dataset()` never called them — every multi-dataset mixture request
  silently trained on nothing but `data.train`'s single path, the same gap #330 and #442
  papered over in their respective renderers. `DataConfig.train` now accepts `str |
  list[str]`; a list of `>= 2` local file paths combines via `data.interleave`
  (`concat` / `under` / `over` / `{strategy: probs, probs: [...]}`) into one row set
  before the existing `val_split` line in `_finalize` runs, so a single path stays
  byte-identical. `interleave` is local-files-only: `training.packing` /
  `training.multipack` and `data.streaming` / an HF-hub dataset name are all rejected
  at config-parse time with a message naming the reason (streaming/hub-dataset
  interleaving is follow-up #459). Both the `kadhi data mix --optimize` recipe writer
  and the `--live` overlay renderer emit the real N-dataset mixture again instead of
  collapsing to one path.

- **A repo-wide documentation ratchet to guarantee declared recipe counts stay synchronized with the catalog (#453 by @harshitthek in #457).**
  Derives the expected count dynamically from `len(RECIPES)` and scans all declared documentation sites, preventing silent Git auto-merge drift across sequential recipe additions.

- Branch coverage for `lr_groups.py`'s `build_optimizer_param_groups`: the case
  where every parameter matches a configured group, so no `base` optimizer
  group is appended (#273 by @AmirF194 in #469).
- Branch coverage for `replay.py`'s `downsample`: the case where the stride
  already lands on the last row, so the endpoint pin is not appended a second
  time (#273 by @AmirF194 in #470).

- Re-enabled `/v1/tools/bash` execution with OS-level namespace/sandbox isolation (#151 by @kok-o in #527). Note this is a breaking change: `serve()` now raises `typer.Exit(code=2)` when run with `--host 0.0.0.0` without `--tool-auth-token`, whereas previously it only printed a warning.

- **`data.interleave` now supports `data.streaming: true` and lists of HF-hub dataset
  names (#459 by @blackcoderx in #468).**
  #443 left `data.interleave` local-files-only, refusing `data.streaming` and any
  remote-URI / hub-name list entry at parse time with a message naming this issue as
  the follow-up. Every `data.train` list entry is now classified once (local file /
  remote URI / HF-hub name) and dispatched: an all-local/remote list with
  `data.streaming: true` delegates combining to HF `datasets.interleave_datasets` /
  `concatenate_datasets` rather than reimplementing mixing over a source whose size
  can't be known ahead of time — `concat` maps to `concatenate_datasets`, `under`/`over`
  map to `stopping_strategy="first_exhausted"`/`"all_exhausted"`, and `probs` maps to
  `probabilities=probs`, each chosen so the strategy names mean the same thing as the
  local path (verified by running one `probs` config through both paths and comparing
  the resulting proportions, not by two tests that each pass alone). An all-HF-hub-name
  list is loaded eagerly per entry and combined with the same `_combine_interleaved` the
  local path already uses; a hub entry's own `validation` split is honoured for the
  combined result only when *every* entry provides one, otherwise it's ignored (warned)
  and `data.val_split` applies to the combined train rows — a decided precedence rather
  than an emergent one. Still refused, by name: an all-hub list with `data.streaming:
  true` (streaming N differently-shaped hub datasets and reconciling their splits is a
  separate, larger effort), and any list mixing hub names with local/remote entries.

- **LISA now accepts `task: pretrain`, not `sft` alone (#307 by @ousamabenyounes in #476).**
  Continued pre-training is the same full-fine-tune-of-a-rotating-set-of-decoder-layers
  mechanism LISA was built for, so the sft-only gate (inherited from Spectrum's
  `unfrozen_parameters`) was arbitrary. The schema task gate now reads a
  `_LISA_SUPPORTED_TASKS` allow-list (`sft`, `pretrain`) and its refusal names every
  accepted task instead of only rejecting yours; `trainer/pretrain.py` replaces its LoRA
  path with LISA and attaches `LisaCallback`, and reports its parameter summary as `LISA`
  counted off the raw parameters, since a LISA run has no `PeftModel` wrapper to ask
  `get_nb_trainable_parameters`. Both trainers route through one
  `peft_wiring.apply_lisa_setup`, so they cannot drift on what "LISA is on" means. The
  rest of the gate is unchanged: `transformers` + `text` + `quantization: none`, mutually
  exclusive with the LoRA feature flags, `freeze_layers`/`freeze_ratio` and
  `unfrozen_parameters`. The released `[0.71.34]` block still says `task: sft`, which is
  what 0.71.34 shipped.

- **A weekly `dependency drift` job, and a test that asks trl what it still
  accepts (#323 in #486).** Two failure classes were structurally invisible until a PR
  happened to be open: a bug that only manifests on a CPU-only runner (a CUDA
  build never calls `_convert_weight_packed_for_cpu`, so no GPU dev box can
  reach it), and an upstream removal behind a floor-only pin. The second one
  shipped for several releases with CI green throughout — `trl>=0.7.0` let CI
  resolve 0.29.1 while the dev box ran 0.19.1, and on 0.29.1 six trainers could
  not build their config at all, because the trl imports live inside `setup()`
  and no test had ever called it.

  `.github/workflows/dependency-drift.yml` runs the same resolve on a schedule:
  it installs the latest resolvable stack, runs the suite against it, and
  writes a resolved-vs-declared table into the run summary. It also flags a
  package declared with incompatible ranges in two extras — which it already
  found before merging: `[mlx]` asks for `transformers>=5.0.0` while `[train]`
  caps it below 5, so `pip install "kadhi-cli[train,mlx]"` cannot resolve.

  `tests/test_issue323_trl_kwarg_drift.py` answers the setup() question without
  a model: it reads the keywords each wrapper passes to its trl config and asks
  the installed class whether it still accepts them, through the same
  `config_accepts` capability probe the wrappers use at runtime — never a
  version comparison, since a version table is what was wrong twice. The
  `resolve_trl_symbol` indirection is followed, so the three configs that moved
  to `trl.experimental` are covered rather than silently skipped. Two blind
  spots are stated rather than implied: `**splat` calls are invisible to a
  static read, and the trl TRAINER classes are excluded because they take much
  of their signature through `**kwargs`, which makes a signature check report
  `model` and `train_dataset` as rejected — measured, and the reason the scan
  filters on `Config`.

- **`kadhi mcp serve` now runs on both mcp majors, and the `<2` cap is lifted
  (#322 in #498).** v0.72.3 capped the `[mcp]` extra the day mcp 2.0.0 broke
  every round-trip test; that unblocked a release and pinned anyone who wanted
  2.x in the same environment. Both removals are bridged rather than pinned
  around: the `@server.list_tools()` / `@server.call_tool()` decorators became
  `on_list_tools=` / `on_call_tool=` constructor callbacks, and
  `create_connected_server_and_client_session` gave way to the lower-level
  `create_client_server_memory_streams`, which both majors still ship.

  `build_server` chooses by probing the `Server` constructor, never by reading
  `mcp.__version__` — the rule `trainer/_trl_compat.py` earned after two wrong
  bounds derived from version tables, and a test walks the AST to enforce it.
  The dispatch logic stays in a single `_dispatch_tool` with two thin adapters,
  guarded by a test that fails if a second implementation appears, because two
  copies is how the majors would drift apart while both kept passing.

  The three modules the sse / streamable-http transports depend on all survive
  2.0.0 unchanged, so those 46 tests needed no edit. Verified by running the
  MCP suites twice, once per major: 184 passed against 2.0.0, and the full
  suite against 1.29.0. The floor stays at the 1.10.0 measured in #296.

- **Added a text-only `qwen3.8-27b-sft` catalog recipe for
  `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` (#477 by @Amix29 in #513).** The recipe explicitly selects
  `modality: text`, uses the measured Qwen3.5-family decoder path from #507,
  and includes catalog, configuration, CLI, modality, and count-sync coverage.

- `kadhi train --cloud lambda` adds cloud GPU training plans for Lambda Cloud instances (Refs #264 by @kok-o in #528).

- Added 7 ready-made SFT recipes - Qwen2.5-Coder 1.5B/14B/32B
  (`qwen2.5-coder-{1.5b,14b,32b}-sft`), Qwen2.5-Math 1.5B/7B (`qwen2.5-math-{1.5b,7b}-sft`),
  and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen 1.5B/7B (`deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-{1.5b,7b}-sft`) - and
  corrected `mistral-small-3-sft` to point at the real hub repo
  (`mistralai/Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501`). Catalog grows 147 -> 154 (#536 by @Nick-800)

- Added #550: a content-addressed two-phase Best-of-N workflow for exporting local
  candidates and materializing verified offline judgments without model or network access (#550 by @Amix29).

- Added 4 ready-made recipes - DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B SFT
  (`deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b-sft`) and three R1-Distill DPO variants
  (`deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-{1.5b,7b}-dpo`, `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b-dpo`) with pinned
  lr and dpo_beta. Catalog grows 154 -> 158 (#569 by @Nick-800)

- #572 adds a weight-free
  Qwen3.8-Flash-Next text-LoRA compatibility scaffold on Transformers 5.16.1,
  including architecture-aware linear targets, MoE detection, and a tiny-config
  forward/backward gate. Legacy int64-only Torch scatter runtimes receive an
  instance-local QSA index compatibility shim; real checkpoint, catalog,
  streaming, multimodal, and routed-expert-parameter support remain explicitly
  unclaimed (#572 by @Amix29).

- #575 adds opt-in PEFT
  `target_parameters` LoRA for Qwen4-Exp routed `gate_up_proj` and `down_proj`
  expert tensors in resident Transformers SFT and continued pretraining, with
  validated compatibility constraints and weight-free backward/save/reload coverage (#575 by @Amix29).

- #576 adds
  `training.lisa_train_embeddings` (default `true` = LISA as published in #267).
  Set it `false` to freeze LISA's always-on group — input embeddings, LM head,
  and final norm — so only the sampled `lisa_num_layers` decoder layers train.
  That always-on group is ~70% of everything LISA trains at 8B, so it is where
  LISA's memory actually goes; freezing it is a real quality/memory trade rather
  than a free win, which is why it is an opt-in knob. Setting it `false` while
  `lisa_enabled` is `false` is rejected, matching the other `lisa_*` fields.
  The analytical VRAM pre-flight still treats LISA as full fine-tuning
  regardless of this flag (it does not yet credit the frozen-embeddings saving,
  which needs a measured constant on GPU hardware), so a frozen-embeddings run
  that would fit can still be conservatively refused — use `--allow-oom-attempt`
  to launch it. Refs #377 (#576 by @Srinivasan8888).

- #582 adds a ready-made
  `smollm3-3b-sft` recipe for HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B. The catalog shipped
  SmolLM2 in three sizes but no SmolLM3; this fills that gap with a small/edge
  LoRA SFT recipe (r8, 8-bit, auto batch). Catalog count 158 → 159. Closes #271 (#582 by @Srinivasan8888).

- Add Qwen4-Exp layer-streamed SFT with sparse read-only PLE N-gram access for dense Transformers and oMLX/oQ affine checkpoints, including an explicit `training.stream_ngram_source` policy and fail-closed task/quantization/media gates (#602 by @Amix29 in #603).

- Added the model-free AutoDistill Milestone A artifact contract: versioned and immutable
  plan/capture/shard/consumption schemas, explicit top-k plus residual-tail semantics,
  transactional resume/corruption rules, and deterministic plan-only estimates
  (#580 by @Amix29 in #613).

- **Added a ready-made `kimi-k2.6-grpo` recipe for moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6
  (#281 by @umran666 in #614).** The v0.71.24 model-family expansion shipped the
  SFT variant but no GRPO reasoning variant; this fills that gap with the MoE
  giant GRPO shape (`grpo_beta: 0.1`, `num_generations: 4`,
  `reward_fn: accuracy`, `moe_lora: true`, `gradient_checkpointing: true`,
  4-bit, `max_length: 8192`), and keeps the Modified MIT licence note in the
  recipe description. Catalog count 160 -> 161.

- **Added a ready-made `qwen3.5-35b-a3b-dpo` recipe for Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B
  (#276 by @Srinivasan8888 in #615).** The catalog shipped the MoE SFT sibling
  `qwen3.5-35b-a3b-sft` in v0.71.24 but no preference-tuning variant; this pairs
  the `qwen2.5-7b-dpo` DPO shape (`format: dpo`, `lr 5e-6`, `dpo_beta: 0.1`) with
  the sibling's MoE settings (`moe_lora: true`, `moe_aux_loss_coeff: 0.01`), and
  carries an explicit `modality: text` so it joins the Qwen3.5-family contract in
  `test_issue427_qwen35_text_modality.py` rather than falling back to the schema
  default. Catalog count 159 → 160.

- Added the internal AutoDistill Milestone B1 same-tokenizer, teacher-only MLX capture and
  transactional shard publication boundary, with immutable input fingerprints, explicit
  corruption/resume checks, and proof that no student model is loaded during capture
  (#580 by @Amix29 in #629).

- **Added a ready-made `qwen3.5-9b-dpo` recipe for Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B
  (#275 by @Srinivasan8888 in #632).** The base already shipped SFT and GRPO
  variants; this completes the trio with the preference-alignment shape
  (`task: dpo`, `format: dpo`, `dpo_beta: 0.1`, `lr: 5e-6`, LoRA r16/a32, 4-bit,
  `max_length: 4096`), matching every other DPO recipe in the catalog. Catalog
  count 161 -> 162.

- Pinned every recipe's *resolved* `KadhiConfig` against a committed snapshot
  (`tests/fixtures/recipe_config_snapshots.json`, regenerated via
  `scripts/generate_recipe_snapshot.py`), so a schema-default change no longer
  silently retunes recipes that rely on that default. Confirmed by mutation:
  changing `dpo_beta`'s schema default failed 149 of the 162 recipes — every
  one that doesn't explicitly pin the field — which is the exposure this
  closes (#621 by @SID-6921 in #637).

- **Added a ready-made `glm-5.1-grpo` recipe for zai-org/GLM-5.1
  (#275 by @Srinivasan8888 in #656).** The base already shipped SFT (v0.71.24)
  and DPO (#280 by @Osheun); this completes the trio with the reasoning shape
  (`task: grpo`, `reasoning_train.jsonl`, `grpo_beta: 0.1`, `num_generations: 4`,
  `reward_fn: accuracy`) over the 754B MoE geometry its siblings already use
  (LoRA r32/a64, `batch_size: 1`, `gradient_accumulation_steps: 16`, 4-bit,
  `moe_lora`, `gradient_checkpointing`, `max_length: 8192`) — deliberately not
  the 30B GRPO template's r16/a32. `lr: 1e-5` is the value both conventions
  agree on: 15 of 22 GRPO recipes and `glm-5.1-sft` alike. The recipe is not
  trained — 754B is multi-node — so no hyperparameter here is a measured
  recommendation. Catalog count 162 -> 163.

### Changed

- **Remove the name-based `SCORER_CHANGED_IN_V0_73_2` baseline warning in favour
  of the #404 scorer_revision stamp (#404 by @AchuthReddy-16 in #485).**
  Stale baselines are detected by provenance, not by a hard-coded suite list.

- **Remove hand-maintained test suite statistics from `CONTRIBUTING.md` in favor of a permanent digit-free shape invariant (#465 by @harshitthek in #467).**
  Eliminates drift across routine test additions by making test-count divergence impossible at the documentation source.

- **Lazy callback builders now self-import their callback class names so runtime
  lookup never raises `NameError` while preserving lazy heavy-dependency loading
  (#320 by @AchuthReddy-16 in #455).** `build_echo_trap_callback`,
  `build_reward_hack_callback`, `build_minillm_callback`,
  `build_rl_checkpoint_callback`, and `build_push_callback` now resolve their
  callback types through local module imports in the builder body, and the
  regression suite adds subprocess coverage for all five builder calls.

- **User-visible changes now use per-PR changelog fragments (#487 by @Amix29 in #490).**
  Contributors add a uniquely named, version-scoped Markdown file instead of editing the
  shared `[Unreleased]` section. A standard-library assembler preserves long entries
  verbatim, rejects stale or malformed fragments, and consumes them during release
  preparation. A tag-time release gate refuses publication if any fragment remains, so
  the conflict is removed without making changelog loss silent.

- **Qwen3.5 and Qwen3.6 text recipes now state their decoder-only intent (#427 by
  @Amix29 in #501).** Apple Silicon measurements confirmed that Kadhi's text path loads
  `Qwen3_5ForCausalLM` without the visual tower, so all twelve catalog recipes now set
  `modality: text` explicitly and regression coverage prevents that decision from falling
  back to the schema default.

- **Transformers training now supports Qwen3.5-family text decoders and can be
  installed together with MLX (#502 and #503 by @Amix29 in #507).** The shared
  stack moves to Transformers 5.12.1+, TRL 0.29+, and PEFT 0.20+, with exact
  floor coverage, matching `kadhi doctor` diagnostics, and capability-based fallbacks
  for TRL APIs that moved under `trl.experimental`. Transformers LoRA
  `target_modules: auto` now covers both
  full- and linear-attention projections in Qwen3.5 text models without
  changing explicit targets or MLX defaults. The compatibility pass also
  updates removed Transformers arguments and keeps TRL 0.29's streamed DPO
  reference adapter off `meta`, so it remains a frozen adapter-sized snapshot
  instead of requiring a second model. DPO and ORPO also restore the removed
  prompt cap on TRL's prepared token ids, so `data.max_length` remains an
  effective sequence bound rather than a configuration-only value. The CLI's
  histogram and loss-curve renderers now support both plotext 5 and plotext 6, with
  a real Plotext 6 runtime pinned in the compatibility CI cell.

- **Unknown config keys are now reported instead of silently dropped, and v0.75 will reject them (#627 by @Srinivasan8888 in #628).**
  None of the config models overrode Pydantic's default `extra="ignore"`, so a key the
  schema did not declare validated clean and was discarded: `kadhi train --dry-run` printed
  "Config valid. Ready to train!", the run exited 0, and the requested setting was never
  applied — `training.quantizaton: none` trained 4-bit quantized when full precision was what
  you asked for, `training.gradient_checkpoint: true` did no checkpointing, `data.max_len: 512`
  truncated at 2048. #623 is the live
  case: `training.stream_pin` reached main two days after 0.73.3 shipped, a user on the
  released wheel wrote the documented escape hatch, and the resulting OOM was investigated
  as a layer-streaming defect. Loading a config now walks the whole model tree — `data`,
  `training`, `training.lora` and the rest, so a guard applied to one model and forgotten on
  another cannot look like it works — and reports every key it cannot place in **one** report
  per load, naming the field you probably meant (`did you mean 'quantization'?`). This is a
  warning, not a refusal: a config written against a newer Kadhi still runs on an older wheel,
  which is the case #623's user was in. **From v0.75 the same config will fail to load** — one
  minor of notice, since this release is the one that starts warning — and the warning names
  that version so the deadline is decidable rather than a permanent notice.
  The version is stated in one constant (`config/unknown_keys.py`) and asserted against the
  declared `kadhi_cli.__version__` by a test, so the release that crosses the deadline turns a
  test red rather than leaving the message promising a rejection that already shipped.
- **`kadhi sweep` now hard-errors on a `--param` that matches no config field, with no deadline (#627 by @Srinivasan8888 in #628).**
  A different failure class from a dropped training key, so it is called out separately: a
  sweep whose swept knob is never applied produces arms that are all identical, and there is
  no partially-useful result to preserve by continuing. `--param lora_rank=8,16` used to run
  the full grid at the base config's LoRA rank and report the winner; the grid is now checked
  before the first arm starts, and `sweep parameter does not match any config field: unknown
  config key 'lora_rank' - not applied.` is printed and the command **exits 1**. Anyone with a
  typo'd sweep parameter will see a new error where they previously got plausible, meaningless
  results, and a scripted sweep now fails instead of succeeding with a table of failed arms.

- **The recipe-config snapshot fixture (#621/#637) is now delta-encoded** —
  a change to a schema default that no recipe explicitly pins now produces
  one failure naming the shared baseline, not 149 identical failures across
  every recipe that relies on it. What's now structurally distinct is
  "a recipe's own value moved" (a named per-recipe test) versus "the shared
  defaults moved" (the one baseline test) — those are different tests now,
  not just different-looking diff text. Measured:
  `tests/fixtures/recipe_config_snapshots.json` goes from 1,571,967 bytes /
  49,586 lines to 66,560 bytes / 2,040 lines — 23.6x smaller by byte count,
  24.3x fewer lines.

  **Traded, not eliminated, and worth stating at the size that actually
  occurs**: a recipe that redundantly pins a value equal to the *old*
  default starts appearing in its own delta once the default moves out
  from under it, since what used to be a no-op pin just started doing
  something — that recipe's resolved config hasn't changed, only its
  relationship to the (now different) baseline has. For a rarely-pinned
  field (`dpo_beta`, 0.1 -> 0.2) that's 13 named recipes plus the baseline,
  14 total, down from 149. For `epochs` (all 162 recipes declare it
  explicitly, distributed `{1: 32, 2: 4, 3: 126}`), moving the default
  3 -> 1 moves 158: the 126 that pinned the old default plus the 32 that
  already pinned the new one — both now differ from a baseline that used
  to match one of them. The 4 recipes pinning `2` stay green, correctly,
  since neither the old nor the new default was ever their value. 158
  named recipes plus the baseline — a wall of red on a change that alters
  no recipe's actual behavior. This is the acceptance criterion "changing a
  schema default fails, naming the affected recipes" holding exactly as
  specified, applied to recipes whose default-shaped pin is the thing that
  moved; it is not the "one failure" case, and the fragment previously
  understated it by only showing the favorable example.

  Verified by mutation against the real catalog: a new schema field
  produces exactly 1 failure (down from 164); a recipe's own value
  changing, a recipe added without regenerating, an empty or deleted
  fixture, and a redundant default-duplicating line being deleted
  (exposure 1, still deliberately unpinned per #621) all behave exactly as
  before (#638 by @SID-6921 in #640).

### Fixed

- **The twelve non-SFT trainers (`dpo`, `kto`, `orpo`, `simpo`, `ipo`, `bco`,
  `online_dpo`, `grpo`, `ppo`, `pretrain`, `reward_model`, `embedding`) loaded
  a frozen LoRA base as float32 regardless of the checkpoint's own dtype
  (#491 by @AmirF194 in #492).** #471 fixed this for the SFT trainer; the
  same `model_kwargs` shape, missing the same key, was unchanged in the
  other twelve. None of them has a full fine-tuning branch, so every load
  there is a frozen base: the new shared `resolve_frozen_base_load_dtype()`
  keeps the checkpoint's own dtype (`torch_dtype="auto"`), except on a
  pre-Ampere CUDA card, where it now matches the float16 compute dtype
  those cards already use instead of leaving the base in bf16 storage.

- **Layer streaming now keeps its host store on CPU on Apple Silicon
  (#434 by @Amix29 in #480).**
  PyTorch 2.7+ can return an MPS tensor for
  `torch.empty(device="cpu", pin_memory=True)`, while `is_pinned()` remains
  false. Direct runtime callers could therefore place the whole frozen base in
  the MPS allocator and still report a pinned RAM store, even though the normal
  `kadhi train` setup already disabled pinning outside CUDA. The runtime now
  disables both optional and required pinning when the target is MPS, and
  `RamSource` independently refuses any allocation that is not genuinely CPU
  memory (or claims pinning without being pinned). MPS proceeds experimentally
  with a pageable CPU source and MPS layer buffers; CUDA pinning behaviour is
  unchanged.

- **CI and production load sites no longer assume Transformers ``dtype=``
  (#478 by @AchuthReddy-16).** ``dtype=`` on ``AutoModel*.from_pretrained`` / ``from_config`` is the
  >=4.56 rename of ``torch_dtype=``. Kadhi still declares
  ``transformers>=4.36.0,<5.0.0``, but the 12-cell matrix only ever installed the
  newest 4.x, so a >=4.56-only kwarg stayed green. Call sites in chat / diff /
  infer / export / merge / serve / mole routing / layer-stream runtime now pass
  ``torch_dtype=`` (still accepted on current 4.57.x). A static AST guard fails
  if a production ``AutoModel*`` load/config site reintroduces ``dtype=``. A new
  Ubuntu/3.11 ``transformers-floor`` job installs under
  ``.github/constraints/transformers-floor.txt`` using the lowest non-yanked
  resolvable Transformers version ``4.46.1`` with the lowest version in the
  declared TRL range ``0.14.0`` (``transformers==4.36.0`` is ResolutionImpossible
  against declared ``trl`` — the declared Transformers floor in
  ``pyproject.toml`` remains unchanged), runs ``pip check``, asserts both pins,
  and runs the guard. The existing 12-cell matrix is untouched.

- **`downsample` now returns at most `max_points` rows, which is what its
  docstring has always promised (#473 in #474).** The stride was
  `len(rows) // max_points` — a divisor, not a cap — so five rows with
  `max_points=2` came back with three, and the endpoint pin could add a
  fourth. Sample indices are now spread evenly across the series with both
  endpoints included, so `kadhi runs replay` renders exactly
  `min(len(rows), max_points)` points. Even spacing also avoids the cliff a
  ceil-based stride would introduce: a series one row over the cap keeps
  `max_points` points rather than roughly half of them. `max_points=1` is the
  one shape where both endpoints cannot fit and returns the final row, which
  is what the endpoint pin existed to guarantee. The off-by-one guard added
  in #470 is kept, renamed to `test_last_index_lands_on_last_row_no_duplicate`
  and re-pinned to the new arithmetic. Consequence of the old behaviour was a
  chart with a few more points than intended, never a wrong number.

- **`cut_ce.py` and `liger.py` now normalize path separators and match architecture
  keywords on the last path component only (#456 by @harshitthek in #458).**
  On Windows, `rsplit("/")` never split on backslashes, causing parent directory
  names (e.g. `C:\experiments\phi-3-runs\step-2000`) to over-match architecture
  keywords during fallback detection when config resolution was unavailable. In
  `liger.py`, switching from whole-path to last-component matching also drops
  org-prefix false positives (e.g. `mistralai/*`, `Qwen/*` when the model name
  does not contain the keyword) and prevents parent directories from applying the
  wrong fused kernel across POSIX and Windows. Both modules now normalize dual
  separators and strip trailing slashes deterministically.

- **`measure_gemm_tflops` now records per-repeat samples and
  `test_takes_the_best_repeat_not_the_first` verifies best-of-N selection within
  a single measurement (#444 by @harshitthek in #451).** Comparing two separate
  probe calls taken at different moments caused intermittent test failures on
  developer GPU machines under background contention. `GemmCeiling` now preserves
  `samples: tuple[float, ...]` and the test asserts `max(samples)` selection
  deterministically.

- **Duck-typed tokenizer mappings no longer raise a misleading error, and
  `data_doctor` shares the public `coerce_token_ids` helper (#441 by @AchuthReddy-16 in #447, part 2 found by @emre155).** A dict-like
  output that is not registered as `collections.abc.Mapping` used to be iterated
  as keys (`input_ids[0]='input_ids'`), sending the operator looking at their
  data; the mask path skipped the same objects and silently dropped
  `assistant_masks`. Both gates now use one mapping-like predicate, and the
  helper is public so the two modules cannot drift.

- **`kadhi data mix --live` handed every candidate proxy run a config it could
  not load (#442 by @blackcoderx in #445).** `_render_overlay_yaml` emitted `data.train` as a YAML
  list, the same shape #330 fixed in the recipe writer, but every `--live`
  test mocked `subprocess.run` so nothing ever loaded the overlay through the
  schema — a config the tool could not itself load read as a passing feature.
  `data.train` now renders as the single highest-weighted dataset in each
  candidate, mirroring #330's fix, with a comment noting which dataset was
  picked and why.

- **`use_cut_ce` silently did nothing for any model loaded from a local
  checkpoint directory, and conflated Phi-2 with Phi-3 (#383 by @AmirF194 in #446).**
  `apply_cut_ce()` picked the CCE patcher by matching an architecture keyword
  against the model path's last component, so `checkpoint-2000` / `my-finetune`
  / any other directory `kadhi merge`/`kadhi shrink`/`kadhi train` writes out
  matched nothing and CCE stayed off with no error, on a flag the user
  explicitly set. Separately, every Phi variant (`phi-2`, `phi-3`, `phi-4`)
  mapped to the same `"phi3"` patcher, even though `cut_cross_entropy` has no
  Phi-2 patcher at all (its `config.model_type` is `"phi"`, not `"phi3"`), and
  a bare `"gemma"` fallback entry dispatched to a patcher `cut_cross_entropy`
  does not have at all, crashing instead of reporting unsupported. Detection
  now resolves `AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_name).model_type` first,
  mirroring the identical fix already shipped for Liger Kernel (#78), and
  falls back to the name-based match only when that is unavailable; Phi-2 and
  plain Gemma-1 both correctly report unsupported instead of running under
  the wrong kernel or crashing. The two call sites that separately hand-wrote
  the "no matching architecture" advisory now share one message.

- **`kadhi draft measure` now refuses a mismatched pair up front and no longer
  discards a completed measurement when the assisted arm fails
  (#344 by @ousamabenyounes in #409).** `measure`
  gated on `same_tokenizer()` (tokenizer vocab + probe ids), which accepts a pair
  whose tokenizers are identical but whose `config.vocab_size` differs by padded
  embedding rows (e.g. Qwen2.5 large←small) — exactly the pair `distill` refuses.
  Transformers' assisted generation gates on `config.vocab_size`, so the run died
  with "different tokenizers" deep inside `generate()`, after the expensive load,
  and because the report was written only after that arm every completed
  acceptance/plain-throughput number was thrown away. `measure` now uses the same
  `config.vocab_size` precondition as `distill` (refusing before any model loads;
  the shared `_vocab_size_of` also reads a composite model's `get_text_config()`,
  so a multimodal target like Llava is no longer refused), keeps `same_tokenizer()`
  as an additional check, and writes the report incrementally so a failing assisted
  arm leaves the acceptance rate and plain throughput on disk. The report records
  an `assisted_status` (`pending` / `complete` / `untimed` / `crash` /
  `interrupted`) so a failed arm is distinguishable on disk from a completed or
  un-run one — `pending` is what a report keeps when the process dies mid-arm
  and no handler runs, which is the case the incremental write exists for.

- **`kadhi export --format gptq` crashed with no calibration data and, when it
  did run, wrote a shard name the standard loader can't find
  (#338 by @AmirF194 in #475).** With no `--calibration-data`,
  `_export_gptq` called `model.quantize(tokenizer)`; auto-gptq's `quantize()`
  expects tokenized examples, not a bare tokenizer, so this failed with
  "object is not iterable". GPTQ export now requires `--calibration-data`
  up front and rejects a file with zero usable samples, since auto-gptq has
  no built-in fallback dataset (unlike AWQ). Separately, `save_quantized`
  writes its own `gptq_model-<bits>bit-<group>g.safetensors` shard, which
  `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained` does not look for; the exported
  directory now also carries a standard `model.safetensors`. The shared
  `except ImportError` blocks on both the AWQ and GPTQ paths also stopped
  reporting a fixed "not installed" string when the package itself imports
  fine but a transitive import inside it fails for an unrelated reason.

- **SmolVLM/Idefics3 vision SFT now reaches real training batches (#302 by
  @Amix29 in #488).** Kadhi keeps LLaVA messages and PIL images together until
  collation, converts legacy `<image>` markers to structured multimodal content,
  and lets the processor produce image-token expansion plus architecture-specific
  pixel tensors. The vision path uses the Transformers trainer with this collator so
  older supported TRL releases cannot pre-tokenize the dataset as text-only. Image
  placeholder ids are excluded from causal-LM labels, and the collator preserves a
  leading BOS whether it comes from the chat template or the tokenizer default.

- Pre-Ampere cards (T4/P100/V100/GTX 16xx — the whole free Colab/Kaggle tier)
  could crash `stream_layers: true` training with `_amp_foreach_non_finite_check_
  and_unscale_cuda not implemented for 'BFloat16'`: peft creates LoRA adapters in
  the base checkpoint's dtype while fp16 GradScaler requires fp32 gradients.
  Trainable `*lora_*` params are now cast to fp32 before optimizer creation from
  every trainer `train()` site through one shared helper (`lora.r: 0`, Spectrum
  and LISA full-FT paths are deliberately untouched so trainable memory does not
  double after the VRAM pre-flight). The #385 static scanner was **narrowed**, not
  weakened: modules that take the precision decision via the shared alignment
  helper now count as covered (#425, #429) (#429 by @lesterppo).

- **`SFTTrainerWrapper` no longer silently upcasts every load to fp32 (#339 by @blackcoderx in #471).**
  All three `from_pretrained` call sites (text/vision/audio) now pass an explicit `torch_dtype`: a
  frozen base (LoRA/QLoRA — the base never receives an optimizer step) preserves the checkpoint's
  own dtype via the shared `resolve_frozen_base_load_dtype()` (#491/#492) instead of defaulting to
  fp32 — pre-Ampere CUDA cards (T4/P100/V100/GTX 16xx/RTX 20xx) get an explicit `torch.float16`
  override there instead of bf16-storage/fp16-compute. A trainable base (`lora.r: 0`,
  `unfrozen_parameters`, `lisa_enabled` — schema-gated to modality='text') loads `torch.float32` as a
  deliberate, documented numerics choice. Measured on an H100 with Llama-3.1-8B, LoRA, frozen base:
  48,241 MiB -> 18,658 MiB peak (2.59x / 28.9 GB), byte-identical across 3 repeats — the original
  #339/#471 benchmark, carried over unchanged in this revision rather than re-measured. The full-FT
  discriminator is a single shared `is_full_finetune()`, used by both `SFTTrainerWrapper` and
  `commands/train.py`'s VRAM pre-flight classifier — previously independent copies that disagreed in
  both directions. `setup()`'s console summary label also now names LISA runs correctly instead of
  mislabeling them "LoRA applied".

- **Every DeepSpeed-capable trainer now prunes the empty LoRA optimizer group,
  not just `sft.py` (#359 in #484).** #336 fixed the failure where LoRA leaves HF's
  no-decay parameter group empty, DeepSpeed drops it, and the LR scheduler
  keeps two `base_lrs` until torch's strict `zip` raises at the first
  `lr_scheduler.step()` — but it fixed it in one wrapper. Measured before
  changing anything: 19 modules under `kadhi_cli/trainer/` accept a
  `deepspeed_config` and exactly one called the guard, so 18 tasks still died
  the same way under `--deepspeed` with LoRA.

  Coverage is enforced by a scan over `kadhi_cli/trainer/*.py` rather than a
  list of names, following `test_device_map_distributed.py` — whose own
  history is the argument, since its first version parametrized over the six
  trainers that fix had touched and passed while nine more sites still carried
  the defect. The scanner requires the guard only where a module both accepts
  a `deepspeed_config` and constructs a trainer itself, so the delegating
  `preference.py` wrapper is correctly exempt, and it carries a control
  proving the pattern can fail.

  `attach_empty_param_group_guard` now declines a trainer with no callable
  `create_optimizer` instead of raising. That is load-bearing once the guard
  is attached from eighteen wrappers rather than one: not every TRL trainer
  exposes the method, and an AttributeError there would convert a
  DeepSpeed-only defect into a crash on the ordinary path.
- **`--deepspeed my.json` is now resolved the way a preset is (#359 in #484).** A
  user-supplied config reached DeepSpeed unresolved, so none of the preset
  rewrites applied to it. The decision recorded: resolve, but only keys that
  are provably invalid for the run. `zero_hpz_partition_size` is refused by
  DeepSpeed when the world size is not divisible by it, and the fp16 quantiser
  against a `bf16` run raises `expected mat1 and mat2 to have the same dtype`
  inside `deepspeed/runtime/zero/linear.py` — neither is a preference. Since
  the documented way to customise ZeRO++ is to copy the preset JSON, which
  copies both defects, an unresolved user file inherited a crash the presets
  are already protected from. A config using none of those keys is returned by
  its own path, byte-identical; a repair is printed and written to a temp copy,
  and the user's file on disk is never modified. Malformed JSON passes through
  untouched, because DeepSpeed reports a bad config better than a traceback.

- **Transformers floor CI now tracks declared dependency metadata (#494 by @Amix29 in
  #496).** The compatibility guard derives the training lower bound from `pyproject.toml`,
  refuses a tested pin below it, requires a documented reason for a higher resolvable pin,
  and makes the workflow read exact versions from the constraints file instead of
  restating them.

- **A server crash between spawning an MCP training job and recording its pid no
  longer lets a restart double-book a second job (#506 by @AmirF194).** The one-active-execution
  cap now treats an unresolved launch as active rather than reading it as free
  capacity.

- **TensorRT-LLM export now fails immediately with a clear message instead of
  silently producing zero artifact bytes (#337 by @AmirF194 in #508).** `_export_tensorrt()`
  shelled out to `python -m tensorrt_llm.commands.convert_checkpoint`, a module
  absent from every current TensorRT-LLM release (`tensorrt_llm.commands` ships
  only `bench/build/eval/prune/refit/serve`; conversion now lives as a
  per-architecture `examples/<arch>/convert_checkpoint.py` script instead). The
  entry point is checked right after the existing `tensorrt_llm` availability
  check, before the LoRA merge and checkpoint directory are touched. Docs now
  warn that installing `tensorrt_llm` can downgrade a training environment's
  `torch`/`transformers`/`numpy`/`datasets` pins.

- Fixed layer streaming's hidden duplicate-disk cost: Kadhi now reuses regular Hugging Face cache files, preflights materialized-weight and shard-cache writes per volume, refuses before exhausting disk space, and explains source-fingerprint cache rebuilds (#510 by @Amix29).

- Layer streaming now admits the dense `qwen3_5` / `qwen3_5_text` decoder used by Qwen3.8-27B after native mixed-attention resident-vs-streamed parity coverage. (#514 by @Amix29 in #515)

- Layer streaming now preserves BF16 checkpoints on capable MPS runtimes instead of silently doubling the store and disk cache to FP32. (#516 by @Amix29 in #519)

- The negative llama.cpp quantizer lookup test is now isolated from binaries installed on the host `PATH`. (#518 by @Amix29 in #520)

- Fixed fresh installs with Plotext 6: `kadhi data stats` histograms and `kadhi runs`
  loss charts now dispatch to Plotext 6's Figure API while retaining the Plotext 5
  module-level path. The temporary `<6.0.0` dependency cap is lifted because both
  supported majors are covered by the compatibility layer and regression tests
  (#507, #522).

- Added `kadhi mcp runs reconcile --expunge-launching` so operators can safely recover
  execution capacity from stale `launching` rows without editing SQLite by hand (#524 by @Amix29 in #525).

- Layer streaming now shards an untied `embed_tokens` and `lm_head` pair separately and
  reuses one vocabulary-sized device buffer instead of keeping both matrices resident (#526 by @Amix29).
  Tied embeddings keep their existing resident one-matrix path and numerics.

- SFT now refuses examples without causal loss targets and final training states
  containing non-finite metrics or parameters before saving artifacts (#535 by @Amix29).

- Streamed LoRA adapters now preserve the exact configured base-model provenance,
  restoring automatic base detection across adapter workflows (#537 by @Amix29).

- Fully cached Hugging Face snapshots can now be materialized and sharded with
  outgoing traffic disabled, while preserving commit and blob integrity (#538 by @Amix29).

- Apple internal NVMe volumes behind APFS and Apple Fabric are now detected for
  the layer-streaming disk tier without requiring a manual override (#539 by @Amix29).

- Response-only masking now supports system-first conversations with native chat
  templates that reject transient prefixes without a user query (#543 by @Amix29).

- The final training panel now preserves the last real loss, learning rate, and
  gradient norm when Transformers emits a summary-only log event (#544 by @Amix29).

- Reproducibility receipts now record the MPS backend, Apple chip name, and
  unified-memory capacity without collecting unique hardware identifiers (#545 by @Amix29).

- Best-of-N now rejects non-finite and boolean judge scores before selecting a
  winner or emitting invalid JSONL (#547 by @Amix29 in #551).

- Best-of-N now rejects malformed prompt rows with line-numbered errors and
  records each accepted row's source line instead of silently losing data (#548 by @Amix29 in #552).

- Fixed #549 by making Best-of-N generation durable and resumable per prompt, with exactly-once
  checkpoint validation and rollback-safe, manifest-last publication that never exposes a partial
  SFT/DPO generation after an output failure (#553 by @Amix29).

- Fixed #555: two-phase Best-of-N candidate export now resumes from durable,
  authenticated per-prompt checkpoints, while offline validation and output
  materialization stream through bounded-memory disk staging. Resume binds
  prompt source lines and exact local-model content, and streamed SFT/DPO
  publication rolls back as one set on failure. Candidate export now seeds each
  prompt independently so resumed runs reproduce the same candidates; this
  changes the output of existing `--export-candidates --seed N` runs (#559 by @Amix29).

- Fixed #556: offline Best-of-N now commits SFT and optional DPO outputs through a
  final verifiable manifest, rejects unsupported online recovery options, and
  makes interrupted or mismatched generations fail closed (#557 by @Amix29).

- **`_assert_finite_training_state` no longer refuses a run over a self-corrected
  transient metric (#546 by @AmirF194 in #560).** The log_history scan now checks only
  the most recently logged value of each metric instead of raising on the first
  non-finite value found at any step, so a GradScaler warm-up nan that recovers no
  longer blocks the final save.

- Live multipack training now packs each bin to `training.batch_size * data.max_length`
  instead of `data.max_length` alone, so the configured batch size actually affects
  packing density again (#562 by @AmirF194).

- #564 enables BF16 autocast for
  hardware-validated resident SFT, DPO, reward-model, and PRM training on capable
  Apple Silicon MPS runtimes. The live capability probe is shared with layer
  streaming; CPU and unvalidated MPS trainers remain FP32, while PRM retains FP32
  master weights to avoid a fatal Metal optimizer dtype mismatch (#564 by @Amix29).

- Preserve reward metadata from local GRPO datasets and keep earlier assistant turns when
  separating a final reference answer from multi-turn conversations (#566 by @Amix29).

- #568 enables runtime-probed
  BF16 autocast for local Transformers GRPO/RLVR on capable Apple Silicon MPS
  runtimes. Unsupported MPS remains FP32, local generation avoids the CUDA-only
  vLLM path, and an Apple Silicon train/save/reload smoke covers deterministic
  RLVR with LoRA (#568 by @Amix29).

- `live_eval`'s four callers now forward `quantization`; `kadhi ship --config` reuses the
  training run's own (#367 by @AmirF194 in #570). #461 added `quantization` to `load_model_and_tokenizer` but
  nothing set it, so an NF4-trained adapter was still judged against a bf16 base.
  `make_generator`, `make_multi_generator`, `lora_probe` and `measure_logit_agreement`
  now accept and forward it. `kadhi ship --config kadhi.yaml` derives a default from
  `training.quantization` (`4bit`/`8bit`; other quant_menu formats still fall back to
  full precision) and prints which precision it loaded, now matching what it actually
  passes to `from_pretrained` (previously the fallback message claimed bf16 without
  ever setting `torch_dtype`). `advise --probe-model`, `diagnose --base-model` and
  `tunability --live` take no `--config`/`--quantization` flag yet, so they keep the
  existing default. Stamping the numerics into the verdict/evidence JSON and a
  staleness gate on mismatched-numerics evidence (issue criteria 2 and 4) stay open.

- #574 corrects the MCP
  execution-tool refusal, which told operators to restart with `--allow-execute`
  and then falsely added that execution tools "are not implemented in this
  version" — execution shipped in v0.73.3 (#297 by @Srinivasan8888 in #574). The refusal now names the
  disabled tool and the flag that enables it, and the stale `build_registry`
  docstring no longer describes `allow_execute` as reserved for future tools.
  Closes #483.

- **Eval-gate LLM judge normalization uses the active rubric scale instead of
  hardcoded `/ 10.0` (#577 by @here-2007 in #578).** `_run_judge_task` in
  `eval/gate.py` divided the aggregate judge score by `10.0`, assuming a 1–10
  scale, while `DEFAULT_RUBRIC` in `eval/judge.py` uses 1–5. A perfect judge
  score of 5.0 normalized to 0.50 instead of 1.00, making typical gate
  thresholds (0.70, 0.80) impossible to satisfy and triggering false-positive
  training stops under `on_regression: stop`. Normalization now dynamically
  derives `scale_min` and `scale_max` from `evaluator.rubric["scale"]` via
  min-max scaling to `[0.0, 1.0]`, clamps out-of-bounds values, handles
  degenerate scales (`min == max`), and aligns with the existing dynamic
  normalization in `commands/ship.py`.

- #581 ports two v0.73.0
  vLLM serve fixes to the SGLang backend, which had the identical pair standing.
  The prompt now applies the model's own chat template via the shared
  `build_chat_prompt` (with the legacy `User:`/`Assistant:` fallback for
  template-less models) instead of a hand-rolled third copy, so the model no
  longer sees a format it was never trained on. And `finish_reason` reports
  `"length"` when a response hits `max_tokens` (on both the sync and streaming
  paths) instead of a hardcoded `"stop"`, so a client doing continue-on-length
  can tell a truncated answer from a completed one. The tokenizer load in
  `kadhi serve --backend sglang` now uses the same `trust_remote_code` setting
  the SGLang runtime itself uses, so a custom-code model no longer falls back
  to the legacy prompt in silence, and the three-branch operator warning vLLM
  prints about the chat template is now printed here too. Live verification
  against a real SGLang runtime on Linux remains an open follow-up on #360 (#581 by @Srinivasan8888).

- `kadhi train` now warns when `training.convergence_detection` is enabled but not
yet wired into the live training loop, matching the existing honesty guard for
other advisory training-intelligence flags (#583).

- **GRPO objective variants now execute without silently falling back to stock
  TRL loss (#584 by @here-2007 in #585).** `_GRPOTrainerVariant.compute_loss()`
  previously checked `inputs` for `per_token_logps`, which is never
  pre-populated by TRL's rollout dataloader. The trainer now obtains
  per-token log probabilities in a single forward pass via
  `_get_per_token_logps_and_entropies` without duplicating forward computation
  or increasing peak VRAM, ensuring `gspo`, `dapo`, `dr_grpo`, `bnpo`,
  `two_sided`, and `rft` objectives train their intended loss formulations.

- PPO's reward model, and `task: reward_model`'s own trained model, now only inherit the
  Quant Menu quantization config when `training.quantize_reward_model` is set (#586 by @AmirF194).
  Since v0.53.0 added that flag, it was validated by its own task-scoped check but never
  read by either loader, so both tasks quantized regardless of the flag's value.

- #588 makes FSDP + BNB
  4-bit training resolve quantized storage and trainable adapter
  parameters to the same floating compute dtype, preventing the integer-storage
  and mixed-dtype flattening failures that made the `llama3-70b-fsdp2` recipe
  unrunnable. The recipe now pins bf16 storage for its A100/H100 target hardware (#588 by @Faisal01011).

- Raised the `accelerate` floor to 0.27.0, the first release whose FSDP
  checkpoint save/load path can be restricted to the trainable adapter. This
  closes a remaining way a LoRA/PEFT run under FSDP could regress back to
  writing the full frozen base model into every checkpoint on an unpinned
  `accelerate` install (#352, #591) (#591 by @AmirF194).

- `_telemetry_endpoint_is_safe` could not reject private/loopback HTTPS
  endpoints because the upstream HTTPS requirement bypassed the
  scheme-conditional private-IP check in `validate_hub_endpoint`. The fix
  layers a telemetry-strict private, loopback, and link-local rejection
  on top of the existing hub sanitisation without modifying `hubs.py`
  (#593, #598) (#598 by @harshitthek).

- **`training.stream_vram_probe` docs now name each ratio's denominator (#595 by
  @umran666 in #605).** Four code sites quoted the probe series (0.992x / 0.830x)
  labelled "the real peak". They now carry BOTH series with their denominators:
  the real-run peak (0.934x at seq 5120, 0.787x at 6144) and the probe series
  (0.992x at seq 4096, 0.830x at 5120) — the gap between them is the probe
  running 12.5-14.3% above the real training step, the conservativeness the gate
  depends on. The field description also carried the withdrawn claim that the probe
  under-measures preference losses badly enough to make the gate unsafe — at the
  one matching shape it reads +13.5% high, the same safe direction it shows for
  SFT, and the `task='sft'` restriction stands because one shape is not a
  validation. Comments and field descriptions only; no behaviour change.

- **`kadhi serve --backend mii` now applies the served model's own chat template
  and reports the engine's real `finish_reason`** (#606 by @ARAVIND281 in #608), instead of a
  hand-rolled `System:/User:/Assistant:` prompt and a hardcoded `"stop"`. The
  backend reuses `build_chat_prompt` and `resolve_finish_reason` rather than
  keeping its own copies, and `serve` loads and passes the tokenizer for the MII
  path as it already does for vLLM. Behaviour is unchanged for a model that
  ships no chat template.

- **The reward-hack ladders' mode split is now documented, and their thresholds
  are pinned by tests (#371 fix-path item 2, by @umran666 in #611).** The H100
  gate record carried an open inconsistency — the beta ladder escalated on four
  consecutive HACK votes while the rollback ladder, requiring three, never
  fired in any arm. The code settles it: the beta ladder lives in `kl_control`
  (no rollback rung), the rollback rung lives only in `pid_lagrangian`, and the
  schema already rejects `reward_hack_rollback` under any other mode — so the
  arm that fired one structurally lacks the other, and every arm with the other
  crashed at #342 before it could run. Documented in the module docstring and
  both run paths; comments only, no behaviour change. Tests pin the remaining
  CPU-testable acceptance criteria: each ladder fires at its documented
  threshold on N consecutive HACK votes with a control at N-1, and the
  `beta == floor` degenerate case the defaults produce.

- `kadhi doctor` now recommends a PyTorch CUDA wheel that matches the
  driver's `nvidia-smi` CUDA version instead of always suggesting `cu121`.
  An unreadable driver header falls back to `cu121` (conservative: a parse
  failure is treated as an old driver, not a new one). Drivers at CUDA 11.8
  get `cu118`. Windows also notes that the PyPI torch wheel is CPU-only.
  (#612 by @MKnaomi2)

- #631 pins the last
  open row of #273: the `74->73` branch of `setup_logging`, which was only
  ever executed incidentally depending on ambient logger state (100% branch
  coverage on one machine, 98% on another). Two hermetic tests now force the
  state: a handler without the `_kadhi_log_tier` tag survives reconfiguration,
  and a Kadhi handler with a stale tier is still removed. Dropping the
  `is not None` guard fails both tests by name (mutation demonstrated and
  reverted). `BrPart` 1 -> 0, for a reason rather than by luck (#631 by @umran666).

- **Three tests no longer fail on a clean checkout when `FORCE_COLOR` is set
  (#633 by @Srinivasan8888 in #635).** `kadhi recipes show` and
  `kadhi data mix --apply` emit syntax-highlighted output, and three assertions
  read that output raw — so on a colour-capable terminal one of them fed ANSI
  escapes to a YAML parser (`unacceptable character #x001b`) and another looked
  for `modality: text` inside a highlighted span. The assertions now normalise
  through a shared `strip_ansi` helper, and a repo-wide AST guard fails on any new
  raw-output assertion against a syntax-highlighted command, so the fourth
  occurrence of this failure class is also the last one that has to be found by
  hand.

- `--resume auto` (and a direct `--resume <path>`) now finds MLX checkpoints.
  `_resolve_checkpoint` only recognized `checkpoint-N` directories (the
  transformers/unsloth shape); mlx-lm's tuner saves step-numbered
  `NNNNNNN_adapters.safetensors` files instead, so an MLX run's own output
  never matched and training silently restarted from scratch every time.
  `MLXSFTTrainerWrapper.train()` now loads the located checkpoint's adapter
  weights before training starts. This is a weights-only warm start, not a
  full resume — mlx-lm's LoRA trainer exposes no optimizer state or step
  count, so the step count and data position both restart from zero
  regardless of how far the checkpoint got, and the run says so. Also
  fixes MLX `--resume` for any config with `experiment_name` set, which
  the first version of this fix missed (#634 reported and diagnosed by
  @imahsanali, fixed by @SID-6921 in #639).

- **`[train]` now declares the torch floor that actually binds, and doctor's
  copy is pinned to it (#636 by @umran666 in #641).**
  `[train]` said `torch>=2.3.0` while requiring `transformers>=5.16.1`, whose
  own torch extra forces `torch>=2.5` — the declared floor could never bind,
  and `kadhi doctor` carried an unpinned second copy on top. The extra now
  declares `torch>=2.5.0` with the reason stated beside it; doctor keeps a
  literal that `tests/test_issue636_torch_floor.py` pins to the declaration,
  and a drift guard compares the declared floor against the *declared*
  transformers floor's real metadata on the `transformers-floor` CI job (which
  installs exactly 5.16.1 under the constraints file), skipping with a reason
  anywhere the installed transformers is a different release rather than
  passing vacuously.
  Closes #636.

- **`kadhi sweep` no longer crashes with an `IndexError` when the run grid is empty (#628 by @Srinivasan8888 in #643).**
  The unknown-parameter precheck added in #628 reads `combinations[0]` to probe the grid, so
  a `--max-runs` value that leaves no combinations — `--max-runs -1`, for instance — raised
  `IndexError: list index out of range` from inside the guard rather than reaching the sweep.
  Nonsense input either way, but the previous behaviour was an empty results table and exit 0,
  and an unhandled traceback is a worse answer than that. The probe is skipped when the grid is
  empty, restoring the old response. Bounding `--max-runs` at `ge=1` would reject the input
  outright and is the better long-term fix; it is a pre-existing CLI contract change and is
  left for its own change.

- `stream_source: auto` now falls back to the NVMe disk tier when the RAM store
  fits `MemAvailable` but the store plus resident extras would exceed Kadhi's
  physical-host safety ceiling, and forced `stream_source: ram` refuses that
  case during pre-flight instead of letting the kernel OOM-kill the process
  (#622 by @ousamabenyounes in #644).

- **`kadhi sweep --dry-run` now validates instead of returning before the
  config loads — and forecloses a latent Python 3.10 crash in the sweep
  pre-flight (#642 by @umran666 in #645).**
  `--dry-run` exits before `load_config` ever ran, so the #627 unknown-key
  warning and the #628 `--param` pre-flight were both unreachable under it:
  the issue's typo'd `quantizaton` printed a grid and exit 0 with no warning,
  while `kadhi train --dry-run` reported it. This is a stated behaviour change:
  `--dry-run` now means "validate, then print the grid without running
  anything", both paths share the single load, and the severity split is
  unchanged — warn-only exits 0, a typo'd sweep parameter exits 1 before
  printing a grid it can never run. On the execution path the same validation
  now happens before the confirmation prompt instead of after it. Making the
  pre-flight reachable exposed a latent crash in it: the probe walks a full
  `model_dump()`, which visits `training.preference_loss_weights`
  (`dict[str, float]`). On Python 3.10 a PEP-585 alias passes
  `isinstance(c, type)`, and whether the subsequent `issubclass` raises
  `TypeError` depends on the pydantic release — `ModelMetaclass` inherits
  the raising check from `ABCMeta` through 2.10.x (verified: every real
  sweep died with `issubclass() arg 1 must be a class` on 3.10.11 +
  pydantic 2.10.6) and defines its own tolerant `__subclasscheck__` by
  2.13.4 (verified under the same interpreter), so the crash was live
  across the unmasked part of the supported `pydantic>=2.0.0` range on the
  oldest supported Python, and a current pydantic masks it — which is also
  how #628 shipped green: its unit tests fed the walker hand-built dicts
  that never reached such a field. `_nested_models` now filters
  parameterized generics via `typing.get_origin`; real-command tests cover
  each branch and the clean-config control, and the filter has a
  deterministic killer (an ABCMeta stand-in recreating the pre-override
  metaclass, pinning the real schema field) plus a control so it cannot be
  "fixed" by never walking.
  Closes #642.

- **Live training panel now labels the GPU figure as `GPU peak:` and reads `max_memory_allocated()` instead of `memory_allocated()` (#650 by @YuriPerro in #652).**
  `on_log` fired between steps, after activations and gradients were freed, so the
  sampled `memory_allocated()` was the inter-step trough -- on the reproducing run
  `5.8/15.9 GB` while `nvidia-smi` showed the device fully occupied.
  The fix uses `max_memory_allocated()`, the lifetime peak, and changes the label
  to `GPU peak:` so the figure is self-describing. `reset_peak_memory_stats()` is
  intentionally not called here: that reset is process-global and would clobber the
  grad-accum advisor's own peak reading at `callback.py:566`.

- **The CUDA batch probe now refuses on a measured peak, not only on a raise
  (#649 by @YuriPerro in #654).**
  Under the WDDM driver (native Windows, WSL2) the allocator spills to host
  memory instead of raising `OutOfMemoryError`, so `make_cuda_probe_fn`'s only
  fit criterion, "the step did not throw", approved a batch 16 that ran an
  order of magnitude slower in shared memory and `pick_batch_size` cached it.
  The probe now reads `max_memory_allocated` after the synthetic step and
  refuses when it exceeds what this process can reach on the device
  (`mem_get_info` free plus what it already holds), mirroring the counter and
  basis `decide_measured_fit` documents for layer streaming; an OOM surfacing
  at a synchronize point as `AcceleratorError` / `RuntimeError("out of
  memory")` is classified as OOM instead of propagating as misconfiguration;
  and the cache key carries a version tag so entries written by the old probe
  are ignored. The WDDM case is covered by a mocked-torch test that needs no
  GPU, with a fitting control beside it.
  Closes #649.

### Security

- **Telemetry and webhook SSRF guards now reject abbreviated, decimal, hex,
  and octal IPv4 forms (#600 by @here-2007 in #604).** `_is_private_or_link_local()`
  in `utils/hubs.py`, `utils/hf.py`, and `utils/webhooks.py` previously delegated
  exclusively to `ipaddress.ip_address()`, which raises `ValueError` on non-canonical
  IPv4 representations like `127.1`, `2130706433`, `0x7f000001`, and `0177.0.0.1`.
  On Linux (glibc), the OS resolver (`getaddrinfo`/`inet_aton`) parses these forms,
  allowing crafted `--slack-url https://2852039166/` webhooks or telemetry overrides
  to reach internal network addresses and cloud metadata (`169.254.169.254`). All three
  guards now normalise non-standard IPv4 literals via in-process `socket.inet_aton()`
  and strip trailing FQDN dots before verifying against `ipaddress.ip_address()`.

- **The SGLang serve backend now obeys the `--trust-remote-code` gate instead of
  loading every model with it enabled (#360 by @Srinivasan8888 in #619).**
  `serve.py` resolves the v0.36.0 default-deny gate once for every backend and
  passes the result to vLLM, but `_serve_sglang` was called without it and
  `create_sglang_runtime` hardcoded `trust_remote_code=True` at both
  `sgl.Runtime` call sites, so `kadhi serve --backend sglang` executed a model's
  custom repo code whether or not the user opted in. The warning panel said so,
  but a notice is not a gate. `create_sglang_runtime` now defaults to `False`
  like the vLLM path, and the resolved value reaches the runtime and the
  tokenizer load alike. **Behaviour change:** a custom-code model on the SGLang
  backend now fails to load without `--trust-remote-code` rather than silently
  running its code.

- **Telemetry SSRF guard now applies a tiered architecture with primary allowlist,
  internal TLD rejection, and DNS defence in depth (#599 by @here-2007 in #624).**
  `_telemetry_endpoint_is_safe()` previously only checked literal IP formats, allowing
  hostnames resolving to private addresses (`10.0.0.1.nip.io`, `localtest.me`) or internal
  TLDs (`metadata.internal`) to bypass validation. The guard now validates via three tiers:
  (1) a primary allowlist for canonical PostHog domains (`*.posthog.com`) with zero DNS
  lookups, (2) static string rejection of internal TLD suffixes (`.local`, `.internal`,
  `.lan`, `.home`, `.corp`, `.intranet`) and literal private IPs, and (3) defence-in-depth
  DNS resolution for custom non-default FQDNs that fails closed on resolver errors/timeouts
  and rejects private or loopback target IPs.

- **The OTLP tracing endpoint validator now rejects abbreviated, decimal, hex,
  and octal IPv4 forms, closing a bypass `#600`/`#604` never reached (#616 by
  @SID-6921 in #625).** `utils/tracing.py`'s `_is_private_ip` predated the
  #604 fix and was never folded into it: it had no `socket.inet_aton`
  fallback. The loopback spellings (`https://127.1:4317` and friends) were
  permitted anyway; the reachable hole was **non-loopback** private ranges in
  alternate encodings — `https://2852039166:4317` and `https://0xa9fea9fe:4317`
  both resolve to `169.254.169.254`, the cloud-metadata address, and both were
  accepted while the dotted-quad form was refused. Same for `10.0.0.5` as
  `167772165` / `0xa000005` / `012.0.0.5` / `10.5`, and `192.168.1.1` as
  `3232235777`. All refused now; `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` and ordinary
  hostnames still pass. Found while consolidating the SSRF
  loopback/private-host predicate, which had drifted into three copies of the
  function and six of the host set across `hf.py`, `hubs.py`, `webhooks.py`,
  `loop_stages.py`, `qr_url.py` and `tracing.py` — issue #616 undercounted, and
  an AST walk during review found the real number. All six call sites now
  import one definition from the new `utils/net_guard.py`, and a guard test
  walks `src/kadhi_cli/` for any function whose name ends in
  `is_private_or_link_local` or constant ending in `LOOPBACK_HOSTS` — matching
  the leading-underscore spelling every original copy used — so a reappearing
  duplicate fails the build. `loop_stages._endpoint_is_local`, a seventh copy
  of the parsing logic guarding the deploy canary, had the same abbreviated-IPv4
  gap; it now shares `net_guard.parse_ip_literal` while keeping its own
  narrower policy, since adopting the wider predicate would change what that
  surface trusts as a local target rather than only where the logic lives.
  **The consolidation is otherwise behaviour-preserving.** The shared
  predicate's `is_reserved` / `is_multicast` clauses do not change any caller's
  outcome: in `hf.py` and `hubs.py` both branches raise, so the predicate
  selects an error message rather than an accept/reject decision, and
  `qr_url.py` imports only the host set. `loop_stages` becomes marginally more
  permissive — it is an allow-list gate, so teaching it `parse_ip_literal`
  makes it recognise 26 further spellings as local — but every one of those
  canonicalises to an address it already accepted, so the set of endpoints Kadhi
  will POST to is unchanged.

## [0.73.3] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **`eval.ship.noise_floor` is now committable to `kadhi.yaml` (#406 by @ousamabenyounes in #410).** Every
  `kadhi ship` gate-policy flag was settable in a committed config and read back by
  `--config` — except `--noise-floor` (added in v0.73.2), which had no field and
  could only be passed on the command line, so a team enforcing a floor in CI had
  to hand-edit the workflow. `ShipConfig` gains a bounded `noise_floor`
  (`[2, 10]`, imported from `ship_verdict` so the schema and the CLI validator
  cannot disagree; bool-as-int rejected), wired with the same CLI > config >
  default precedence as the other five flags. As a live-measurement input it is
  measured only when producing evidence and refused under `--evidence` exactly as
  the flag is; it follows `forgetting_threshold` in being excluded from the
  recipe `config_sha`, so setting a floor never invalidates evidence.

- **A ready-made `qwen3.5-4b-pretrain` recipe for continued pre-training of
  `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B-Base` (#278 by @Faisal01011 in #422).** The recipe uses plaintext data, one epoch,
  QLoRA 4-bit quantization, and the established continued-pretraining defaults.

- **A ready-made `deepseek-v4-flash-grpo` recipe for GRPO reasoning training
  with `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash` (#279 by @Faisal01011 in #432).** The recipe combines the
  established GRPO defaults with MoE LoRA and gradient checkpointing.

- **`kadhi mcp serve --allow-execute` can now actually execute, behind a single-use
  confirmation token (#297 by @CODING-DARSH in #393).** `train_start` and `export` issue a
  short-lived, server-generated token bound to the plan and to the execution kind;
  `train_execute` / `export_execute` accept **only** that token — no command, no argv, no
  shell string, no client-supplied environment — and the server launches the planned Kadhi
  CLI command with `shell=False`, `stdin=DEVNULL`, output to `.kadhi/mcp-runs/<run_id>.log`.
  Two integrity properties close the gap between planning and running: the config is
  **snapshotted** at plan time and executed from the copy, so the file cannot be edited
  underneath the run, and `digest_file` now walks a directory tree by content (sorted
  relative paths + per-file hash, symlink refusal, bounded) rather than by mtime+size,
  which did not change when a file *inside* a protected directory was rewritten — so a
  model could be swapped between plan and execution and revalidation still passed. Token
  consumption and capacity acquisition happen before `Popen`, so a failed spawn requires a
  fresh plan rather than enabling replay. Runs go through the existing `ExperimentTracker`,
  so `kadhi runs` sees what MCP started.

### Changed

- **The MLX SFT dispatch route no longer imports the Transformers SFT wrapper
  before choosing a backend (#394 by @Shutaru in #431).** The wrapper is import-light
  today, but the standalone `kadhi-cli[mlx]` runtime no longer depends on it
  remaining so. An additive Apple Silicon CI job verifies that `mlx` and
  `mlx-lm` import, the PyTorch/TRL training stack is absent, and a one-step real
  CLI SFT run completes. This hardens the runtime boundary; it does not claim to
  resolve the still-unpinned torch-present hang reported in #394.
- **`kadhi card` now links the ML-BOM and the in-toto/SLSA attestation — they are
  first-class registry artifact kinds (#309 by @ousamabenyounes in #420).** `bom` and `attestation` were the
  two compliance documents `kadhi card` could not surface: `RegistryStore` had no
  such kinds, so there was no way to attach them. Added both to the valid-kind
  set and a `--attach-to-registry <id>` flag to `kadhi bom emit` and
  `kadhi attest emit` (mirroring the existing `--attach-to-registry` pattern);
  once attached they appear in the card's artifact table for free. Signed
  attestations also attach the detached `.sig` sidecar. The flag needs
  `--output` (omitting it exits 2), and a requested registry attachment failure
  exits 1 after preserving files already emitted.

### Fixed

- **Assistant-only masking no longer mistakes `BatchEncoding` keys for token
  ids (#430 by @Shutaru in #439).** Tokenizer mapping outputs are read through `input_ids`, and
  tensor-like ids are normalised to Python integers before they reach the
  collator; missing or non-integer ids now fail loudly instead of building a
  garbage label mask. A template that returns an all-zero assistant mask while
  assistant messages exist now falls back to incremental rendering, avoiding a
  silent all-`-100` no-op training run. The same mapping assumption was removed
  from the data doctor.

- **`kadhi data mix --optimize` wrote a recipe `kadhi train` could not load
  (#330 by @blackcoderx in #440).** `render_mix_recipe_yaml` emitted `data.train` as a YAML list of
  every searched dataset, but `DataConfig.train` is typed `str`, so the recipe
  failed to load with `data -> train: Input should be a valid string`.
  `data.train` now renders as the single highest-weighted dataset from the
  search; the full ranked weight/path breakdown is kept as a comment above it
  so no information is lost, and the comment explains that `data.interleave`
  is not yet consumed by training.

- **Layer streaming now verifies that every trainable LoRA parameter has real
  storage after PEFT attaches the adapter (#433 reported by @lesterppo, fixed by @Faisal01011 in #435 and #437).** PEFT 0.18 creates streamed
  adapters on `meta` for Kadhi to materialise, while PEFT 0.19 may create them as
  real tensors immediately, so `materialize_meta_adapters()` returning `0`
  cannot distinguish a healthy no-op from a missed adapter. The streamed build
  now enforces the actual postcondition and refuses to install the runtime if a
  trainable `lora_*` parameter remains on `meta`, naming the stranded parameter
  instead of allowing a silent no-training run.

- **Windows process liveness misread a process that exited with code 259 as
  still running, forever (#424 by @blackcoderx in #436).** `GetExitCodeProcess` returns `STILL_ACTIVE`
  (259) for a genuinely running process, but 259 is also a legal exit code, so
  a child that exited *with* 259 was indistinguishable from one still running.
  That silently defeated `ExperimentTracker`'s reconcile-on-read (#401) and
  could wedge the MCP server's one-active-execution cap (#402) shut, refusing
  every subsequent execution with no error an operator could act on. The check
  now waits on the process handle with `WaitForSingleObject(handle, 0)`, which
  is signalled the instant the process exits regardless of its exit code,
  falling back to the exit-code read only if the wait itself fails. The two
  byte-identical copies of this primitive in `experiment/tracker.py` and
  `mcp_server/execution.py` are now one shared `utils/process_liveness.py`.

- **`kadhi train --no-reexec` now prints the flags you actually typed (#372 by @AchuthReddy-16 in #415).**
  The advisory `accelerate launch` command is derived from the same argv the
  auto-reexec would have used, so `--fsdp` / `--deepspeed` / `--config` (and the
  rest of the run-shaping tail, including `--name` and `--replay`) cannot silently
  fall off the printed hint. Following that line used to train without FSDP.

- **`detect_device()` and `get_gpu_info()` now recognise Apple Silicon MLX (#423 by @harshitthek in #428).**
  Previously on Apple Silicon, `detect_device()` only probed PyTorch MPS and fell back
  to `'cpu'`, triggering a false `Warning: 4bit quantization is not supported on CPU`
  alert and silently downgrading `quantization` from `4bit` to `none`. Device and GPU
  info detection now accept an optional `backend=` parameter: passing `backend="mlx"`
  resolves to `'mlx'` with the chip name (e.g. `Apple Silicon (Apple M2 Max)`), preserves
  4-bit quantization intact for `mlx-lm` pre-quantized models, reports Apple unified
  memory in telemetry, and skips the CUDA-shaped analytical VRAM preflight on MLX runs.
  The preflight skip is pinned by `TestHardwareFitGateIsMlxAware` (mirrors the
  streaming-aware gate test). The known-limitation warning in
  `docs/backends-and-ops.md` is replaced with the resolved behaviour.

- **A run whose watcher died was reported `running` forever (#401 by @ousamabenyounes in #407).**
  `ExecutionManager._watch` runs as a `daemon=True` thread, so when the MCP
  server process exits it is killed without unwinding and `finish_execution`
  never runs — `ExperimentTracker` kept the run at `running` with no watcher
  left to correct it, training the operator to ignore the one status field that
  guards against a second concurrent run. The tracker now reconciles on read:
  when a `running` row carries a pid whose process is gone, `list_runs` /
  `get_run` rewrite it to `terminated` with an unknown (`None`) exit code — an
  unknown outcome is never recorded as success, and the richer
  `completed`/`failed` terminal statuses are left untouched. `kadhi runs` no
  longer hardcodes `running` for a non-running row.
- **Layer streaming now accepts a fast virtio/cloud disk instead of refusing it
  as an HDD (#365 by @ousamabenyounes in #411).** `detect_disk_kind` trusted `/sys/block/<dev>/queue/rotational`,
  which a paravirtual (virtio) block device defaults to `1` with no media hint —
  so a genuinely NVMe-backed cloud disk (measured 1.5 GB/s read) was classified
  `hdd` and denied the disk-overflow tier, the very audience the tier targets.
  `rotational=0` stays authoritative (solid state); when the flag is unreliable
  (`rotational=1`), the media type is now decided by a bounded, O_DIRECT
  sequential-read measurement rather than the flag — NVMe-class throughput
  (>= 1 GB/s) earns the tier, a genuinely slow disk still classifies `hdd` and is
  still refused (160 seeks/step, plan P11). A new `training.stream_disk_kind`
  override (`nvme`/`ssd`/`hdd`) is the escape hatch for the case where even that
  is wrong; it prints what it overrode beside what was detected. Disk detection
  may write a small scratch file next to the streamed shards to run the probe.

- **The one-active-execution cap could double-book after a server restart (#402 by @ousamabenyounes in #408).**
  `ExecutionManager._active_run_id` is in-memory, so a restarted MCP server
  started with an empty slot, saw free capacity, and would launch a second
  training while a child from the previous server (which survives a client
  disconnect, #297) was still using the GPU. The cap is now gated on a
  persisted run whose recorded pid is still alive: a live prior child blocks a
  new execution across restarts, while a stale record whose process is gone
  frees the slot rather than wedging it shut. `docs/commands.md` now states the
  actual scope of the cap.

- **`kadhi ship --noise-floor` now measures the leg-1 task axis in the judge modes,
  so a judge-scored win smaller than the judge's own noise no longer counts (#403 by @ousamabenyounes in #419).**
  The floor was measured in `--task-mode metric` only; `judge_score` / `pairwise`
  printed a warning and left leg 1 at a 0.0 floor, i.e. the exact blindness the flag
  exists to remove. It is now measured: `judge_score` scores the base side N times
  through the judge, and `pairwise` judges the base model against itself (expected
  win-rate 0.5, so the spread is directly measured, not inferred). Because those
  repeats fold in the judge's own sampling noise, the floor is labelled
  `decode + judge` on the panel and stamped `judge_inclusive` in the evidence/JSON
  block so it is never read as a decode-only number. `--help` states the extra
  judge-API cost.

- **`training.bnb_4bit_use_double_quant` was validated but never read — every 4-bit
  path Kadhi builds the `BitsAndBytesConfig` for hardcoded double-quantization to `True`,
  so `bnb_4bit_use_double_quant: false` passed validation and was silently ignored (#321 by @ousamabenyounes in #418).**
  The flag is now threaded through the three call sites Kadhi owns — the resident loader
  (`build_quantization_config_for_loader`), the layer-streaming path (`stream_setup` reads it
  once and passes the SAME value to the sharder and the meta skeleton, so streamed-vs-resident
  bit-exactness cannot drift), and the 4bit save path (`kadhi merge --no-double-quant` for the
  `4bit` / `4bit_forced` save formats). The Unsloth loader is out of scope: `FastLanguageModel`
  builds its own `BitsAndBytesConfig` internally with double-quant hardcoded on and exposes no
  override, so that path cannot honour the flag. The schema field is now tri-state
  (`Optional[bool]`, unset = `None`): unset resolves to the shipped default (double-quant on),
  so a run that never set the flag trains identically, but because the resolved config now
  carries the field, `kadhi ship --evidence` provenance and `kadhi lock check` will report a
  one-time fingerprint drift on a previously-unset config even though the model numerics are
  unchanged. The config-load footgun (`=true` requires `quantization: 4bit`) fires only on an
  explicit `true`, and unset serializes as `None`, so a dumped-and-reloaded config no longer
  trips it.
- **`kadhi env check` now flags an installed package that violates Kadhi's own
  declared version bound (#368 by @ousamabenyounes in #421).** `pip install "kadhi-cli[serve-fast]"` (vllm)
  into a training venv silently pushes `transformers` past the `<5.0.0` cap Kadhi
  declares, producing an environment Kadhi's own metadata says is unsupported with
  no warning at any point. `env check` audits installed versions against the
  bounds read from package metadata — not a hardcoded copy, since a second copy
  of the cap is exactly the drift this catches — and exits 3 when one is violated,
  independent of any lock file. An `extra == "X"` requirement is Kadhi's bound
  only when `[X]` was opted into, which the running environment cannot confirm,
  so its marker is evaluated and it is skipped rather than raised as a false
  positive — except for the ABI-relevant `TRACKED_PACKAGES` set, which since the
  v0.71.0 deps-split lives in metadata *only* under `extra == "train"/"all"/
  "dev"` and therefore includes the `transformers <5.0.0` case #368 was reported
  about. A package is counted once even when its bound is restated under several
  extras. If `packaging` is somehow unimportable the audit still degrades to a
  clean report so `env check` keeps working, but now says so rather than
  reporting a silent clean it never verified. The bounds audit no longer
  short-circuits the lock diagnostic (both
  print). `packaging` is a declared dependency now — the audit degraded to a
  silent "clean" without it, the wrong direction for a checker.
  `docs/serving-and-export.md` states the separate-environment guidance for
  `[serve-fast]`.

- **`kl_control` rewrote the trainer's β/kl_coef on every step, including a `hold`, so a
  non-acting run was numerically identical to `log_only` (#371 by @AmirF194 in #414).** `_run_bang_bang` called
  `_apply_coefficient` unconditionally; on a `hold` the controller writes back the value
  already there, which is a no-op value but not a no-op write. The write is now skipped when
  the bang-bang step holds, and the mitigation log records `mitigation_status` (`held` /
  `acted` / `released`) so a non-acting step is distinguishable from an acting one without
  parsing the free-text `action` reason.

- **`extract_mcq_letter` scored zero for `\boxed {A}` — whitespace between the
  command and the brace (follow-up to #357, by @ousamabenyounes in #396).** The shipped `\boxed\{` regex tolerates spaces
  *inside* the braces but not between `\boxed` and `{`; LaTeX permits it there and
  models emit it, so `\boxed { C }` still read as no answer and was not rescued by
  the cue tier either. The boxed-letter regex now allows `\s*` after the command.

- **`kadhi draft distill --steps N` now delivers ~N optimiser steps instead of
  N/4.44 (#364 by @ousamabenyounes in #399).** The epoch count that realised `--steps` divided the request
  by `rows // batch_size`, ignoring that `val_split` (0.1) removes rows from
  training and `gradient_accumulation_steps` (4) micro-batches make one
  optimiser step — both divide the budget, so every distill run trained for
  roughly a fifth of the requested steps, silently. Epochs are now derived from
  the effective steps-per-epoch, the emitted config pins the run shape
  (`val_split`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`) so the arithmetic and the trainer
  cannot drift, and the pre-flight prints the resolved step count.


- **`MitigationLogWriter` silently dropped every record once its parent directory
  vanished mid-run (#343 by @ousamabenyounes in #398).** `record()` reopens the log per call and swallowed the
  `OSError` from `open("ab")` with a bare `return`, so when a shared temp root was
  cleaned by another process the controller kept acting while its log quietly stopped
  growing — the run completes while its evidence goes missing, the failure shape this
  project treats as the worst kind. The writer now recreates the directory and retries
  the write, and surfaces the loss once via a warning naming the path. `record()` still
  never raises, so a vanished log never takes down the training run.

## [0.73.2] - 2026-08-15

`kadhi ship`'s leg 2 is the project's differentiator, and it was lying in both
directions: two of its suites ranked by the wrong thing, one whole failure
direction had no detector at all, and a caller error was indistinguishable from
a regression. Every item below was reproduced on the dev box against the
shipped v0.73.1 code before a line was changed.

### Added

- **`kadhi ship --noise-floor N` — measure what the instrument can resolve
  before calling a delta significant.** Greedy decoding is not deterministic on
  GPU: measured on an H100, the same model with no adapter over five runs spread
  **0.015 strict / 0.020 format-blind**, and `kadhi ship` compared against a 0.05
  threshold without ever telling the operator what its own instrument could
  resolve — four of six paired deltas in that session sat inside the floor. With
  the flag, the BASE model is re-run N times (2–10), the per-axis floor is
  `max − min` across the repeats, it is printed beside the verdict, and every
  axis is then gated at `max(threshold, floor)`. Leg 1 must clear the task
  axis's floor too. The `max` is load-bearing in both directions: a floor above
  the threshold widens the gate to what is actually measurable, and a floor
  below it must never tighten the gate behind the operator's back. Opt-in, so no
  existing run changes; costs N extra base passes. **The leg-1 floor is measured
  in `--task-mode metric` only** — in the judge modes a repeat would fold the
  judge's own sampling noise into a number presented as decode noise, so the run
  warns and leaves leg 1 at a 0.0 floor instead. Carried caveat, because it
  bounds the claim: n=3, one model, one dataset. It **sizes** the effect; it does
  not calibrate a threshold.
- **A benign-prompt axis, `mini_over_refusal`, joins the default leg-2 suite
  (7 → 8) (#317).** Leg 2 flagged a *drop* in `mini_safety` and had no reverse,
  so a tune that refuses everything registered as a monotone safety improvement
  with no ceiling on how useless the model became. Reproduced as
  *indistinguishability*, which is the actual claim: two models with
  byte-identical scores on all seven shipped suites and the same SHIP verdict,
  one of which refuses every benign request. The new suite is 40 hand-authored,
  original benign-but-scary-sounding requests (defensive security, first aid,
  sysadmin verbs like "kill"/"terminate", fiction with dark themes) scored as
  *fraction NOT refused*, so the existing regression rule catches over-refusal
  with no change to the verdict engine. Paired with `mini_safety` neither axis
  can be gamed alone. Same caveat as above: 40 prompts and one greedy pass size a
  gap, they do not calibrate a threshold.
- **Semantic Stratified Splitting for `kadhi data split` (#388).**
  `--stratify-semantic` and `--num-clusters` partition splits proportionally
  across semantic groups (TF-IDF + K-Means) so a whole topic cannot land
  entirely in one split. `scikit-learn` is a declared member of the `[data]`
  extra and a missing import refuses with the install command rather than
  silently falling back. 50k-row cap, an explicit error for a pure-stop-word
  corpus, and a warning when `--num-clusters` is passed without the flag.

### Fixed

- **`extract_mcq_letter` did not know `\boxed{C}`, and the MCQ prompt never
  asked for a letter (#357).** Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct scored **0.423 on
  `mini_mmlu` — below a 0.5B** — while scoring 1.000 on two other MCQ suites. Of
  15 failures, 8 boxed the right letter and 6 boxed a *value* because nothing in
  the prompt asked for a letter. Reproduced here at the extreme: a stub that
  answers every item CORRECTLY in the boxed-letter style scored **0.000** on
  `mini_mmlu` and `mini_common_sense`. Both halves are needed — the extractor
  alone is worth +8 items, the prompt alone **0**, together 0.423 → 0.731 and the
  inversion disappears. The new tier fires **only** when the box holds a single
  A–J letter: reading `\boxed{4}` as "option 4" would be a wrong credit, not a
  repair. Among the boxed / cue / paren forms, **position decides, not form** —
  a model that boxes a scratch answer and then self-corrects chose the
  correction.
- **`mini_tool_call` ranked by brace hygiene (#346).** The 8B named the right
  tool **40/40** and scored 0.225: it emitted three opening braces and two
  closing ones, the whole-string parse failed, the bounded scan returned the
  INNER object, and the scorer rejected it for having no `"function"` key. The
  gate suite's own unwrapping layer now restores the envelope for an object
  carrying **both** `name` and `arguments` — requiring `arguments` is what stops
  an echoed `{"name", "description"}` menu entry from scoring, i.e. from
  crediting copying. The missing brace is the model's own output, **not**
  truncation; that attribution was believed and shipped in `c87fd00` before a
  budget sweep disproved it.
- **`score_bundled_suite` returned `0.0` for a non-callable `gen` (#355).** On
  the three behavioural suites it scored 0.0 while the MCQ suites raised
  `TypeError` — and in leg 2 a 0.0 reads as "the model failed every item" →
  DON'T SHIP, so a caller error was indistinguishable from a regression **and
  failed in the direction that looks like a finding**. Both branches now raise.
  A *callable* that misbehaves is still a failed item, which is the correct
  existing contract.
- **The verdict panel silently ate its own leg-1 marker.** `render_ship_panel`
  built its header as `... [{won_str}]`, and a bare `[no win]` is valid Rich
  markup for an unknown tag — so the panel never printed "won"/"no win" on any
  release up to and including v0.73.1. The plain-text rubric, which has no markup
  parser, printed it correctly the whole time, which is why it went unnoticed.
  Found while rendering the new noise-floor panel.
- **Untrusted names could drive the terminal.** Benchmark and noise-floor axis
  names come from an `--evidence` JSON file, and `rich.markup.escape` neutralises
  Rich's `[...]` syntax and nothing else, so a raw ESC byte survived it. Both
  render paths now strip C0/DEL first, matching the `_for_terminal` pattern
  already used in six other command modules.
- **The `--evidence` round-trip and the MCP `ship_evidence` tool now agree.** A
  verdict decided against a measured floor does not replay without it, so the
  floor is part of the evidence schema (#312's output-is-input property), and
  **both** readers honour it — a schema extended in one consumer and not the
  other would have made the same file replay to different decisions through the
  CLI and through `kadhi mcp serve`.
- **A duplicated `#392` CHANGELOG entry.** PR #388 branched before `18a278a`
  moved that entry into `[0.73.1]`, and the merge re-introduced it under
  `[Unreleased]`, listing the same fix twice.

### Security

- **An evidence-supplied noise floor is bounded and never silent.** A floor
  widens the gate, so `"floors": {"mini_mmlu": 1.0}` in an evidence file masks
  any possible drop on that axis. This does not cross a new trust boundary —
  anyone who can edit that file can already write `{"base": 0.9, "tuned": 0.9}`
  and force a SHIP outright — but it is a far quieter edit to miss in review, and
  `kadhi ci init` wires `ship --evidence` as a PR merge gate. Values are therefore
  bounded to `[0.0, 1.0]`, the mapping is capped at 50 axes / 256-char names
  (mirroring the CLI's own limits), a malformed block is **refused rather than
  dropped** (a dropped floor replays as a different verdict), and any floor that
  exceeds `--forgetting-threshold` is announced — on stderr by the CLI, and in
  the returned payload by the MCP tool, whose stdout is the JSON-RPC channel.
  Neither reader is the quiet one.

### Changed

- **`decide_ship` now canonicalises the `TaskWin` it stores**, as it already did
  for the benchmark deltas. It recomputes leg 1 from the raw scores, so a
  `TaskWin` built without the floor would otherwise have rendered "won" beside a
  DON'T SHIP decided with it.
- **`--baseline` snapshots taken before this release are on a different scale**
  for `mini_mmlu`, `mini_common_sense` and `mini_tool_call`, because their
  scorers changed. A stored baseline skips the live base run, so it would be
  diffed against a freshly-scored tuned model — measured on an *unchanged* model
  the jumps are 0.423 → 0.731 and 0.225 → 1.000, far larger than the 0.05 gate.
  `kadhi ship` now warns by name when `--baseline` supplies a stored score for an
  affected suite. `mini_instruction` and `mini_arithmetic` are unaffected and are
  deliberately not named: neither carries a single-letter answer, so the prompt
  cue and the option-letter extractor never touch them (verified, 0 of 24 and 0
  of 36 items).

## [0.73.1] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **`training.stream_vram_probe` decides the layer-streaming VRAM pre-flight on a
  MEASUREMENT instead of the fitted formula (#349).** The pre-flight predicts peak
  VRAM from a formula fitted to 10 real runs, and its documented contract is that it
  never under-predicts. Measured through the real `kadhi train` on an RTX 3050 Laptop
  (4 GB, Windows, torch 2.5.1) with SmolLM2-135M streamed in bf16 at batch 1, that
  contract holds at short sequence and then fails:

  | seq | predicted | real peak | ratio |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 4352 | 3.282 GB | 3.036 GB | 1.081x — over-predicts, safe |
  | 5120 | 3.844 GB | 4.118 GB | **0.934x — under-predicts** |
  | 6144 | 4.590 GB | 5.830 GB | **0.787x — under by 21%** |

  Under-prediction is the direction that does not announce itself: an OOM on Linux,
  and on Windows/WDDM a silent spill to host memory. The existing grid could not
  have caught it — all ten of its rows are at seq 256 or 512, so it varies batch and
  says nothing about sequence length, and `test_never_under_predicts` has been
  narrowed to state that scope rather than imply a global guarantee.

  With the flag on, one real forward+backward runs at the configured shape after the
  streamed model is built and its peak decides; the prediction is printed beside it
  so a divergence is visible. Measured cost: **1.0-5.3 s** (SmolLM2-135M at 1x1024
  and 2x2048; Llama-3.1-8B NF4 at 1x512), against a training run of minutes to hours.
  Off by default — it costs a step, and it can refuse a run the formula accepts.

  Scope is deliberately narrow. **`task: sft` only**: the probe runs a plain causal-LM
  step, which *is* the SFT step but is not a preference loss, so its agreement with one
  is not established. Measured at a single matching shape it is conservative there too
  (6.02 GB against a real DPO step's 5.30 GB, +13.5%) — but one point is not a
  validation, and a sign flip would mean a gate waving through over-budget runs. It also **cannot overrule a
  prediction more than 4x over budget**: the largest disagreement ever measured is 21%,
  so beyond a small multiple the config is simply too big and is refused by arithmetic
  without touching the GPU. The gate reads `max_memory_allocated`, not
  `max_memory_reserved` — reserved runs 1.08-1.41x allocated and overshoots what has to
  fit, and gating on it would refuse this feature's own flagship configuration
  (Llama-3.1-8B NF4, 3.70 GB reserved against 3.45 GB free, which runs).

  Two readings were tried during this work and **withdrawn as unsupported**, recorded
  because the tempting inference was wrong twice in one investigation: that preference
  losses are over-budgeted ~8.8x (it is 1.15x at the budgeted shape — the earlier figure
  came from rows that realised 142 of a budgeted 2048 tokens), and that the over-budget
  runs were silently spilling (`num_alloc_retries` was 0 on every shape measured). The
  mechanism behind the long-sequence divergence is likewise **not claimed**: `seq**2`
  from the attention score matrix is the obvious candidate and the numbers do not settle
  it.

### Fixed

- **The MLX `adapter_config.json` shipped `target_modules` unresolved, so a default
  MLX adapter loaded as a silent no-op (#392).** `_apply_lora` resolved
  `target_modules: auto` into a local variable and trained the resolved modules; the
  writer serialised the raw config value, so the shipped file carried
  `{"keys": ["auto"]}`. On load, `linear_to_lora_layers` matches no module against that
  and `load_weights(strict=False)` drops every LoRA tensor without a word — generation
  with the adapter is bit-identical to the base model. `"auto"` is the schema default,
  so this was every MLX run that did not name its modules by hand, and the file exists
  precisely to promise the output dir loads with
  `mlx_lm.load(..., adapter_path=...)`. Both callers now go through one
  `resolve_mlx_target_keys()`, because two copies of "which modules did we train?" is
  how they drifted. Reported with a root cause and a control by
  [@armanbot-jpg](https://github.com/armanbot-jpg): hand-editing `keys` in the saved
  file makes the very same `adapters.safetensors` produce the tuned behaviour.

- **`training.batch_size` accepted 0 and negative values.** `Union[int, Literal["auto"]]`
  carried no lower bound, so `batch_size: -4` loaded and then meant whatever each
  trainer's arithmetic did with it — including the streaming VRAM pre-flight, which
  multiplies by it. Now rejected at config load. Surfaced by the #349 security review.

### Fixed

- **Layer streaming's VRAM pre-flight now actually calls its own calibration hook (#348).**
  `calibrated_logits_bytes_per_element()` exists to raise the budget when a stack's loss
  path measures a heavier retention than the shipped constant assumes, guarding against a
  future stack silently under-budgeting by 12.5% with nothing to catch it. `_stream_budget_lines`
  called `estimate_stream_peak_vram()` without `logits_bytes_per_element=`, so the parameter
  was always `None` and the calibration never ran outside its own test. It is now forwarded to
  both the budget and the panel's `logits` figure; the value can only raise the prediction
  (floored at the shipped constant), and the panel prints an extra line naming both numbers
  when the calibration measures above it. This makes the probe unconditional rather than
  opt-in (see #327 below, whose wording is updated to match): every streamed run now pays
  one transient `14 * vocab_size * max(tokens)` allocation (96 MiB at the defaults) plus two
  `torch.cuda.synchronize()` calls before the fit decision is taken. On today's measured
  stacks this is a no-op in effect (`measured` is 12.0 with zero spread, `max(14, 14)` is
  14, no extra line prints), so the cost buys nothing yet, which is the point of a guard
  against a stack that hasn't shipped.
- **MLX backend now actually dispatches to the MLX trainer for `task: sft`.** Previously `backend: mlx` silently fell through to the transformers `SFTTrainerWrapper`, training on MPS/CUDA instead of MLX. The trainer was also rewritten for mlx-lm >= 0.31 (`create_dataset` + `CacheDataset`, `TrainingCallback`), with `model.freeze()` before LoRA — without it the saved "adapter" was a full fine-tune (172 tensors vs 24 LoRA tensors on a 1.2B model) — and an `adapter_config.json` is written so the output dir loads directly with `mlx_lm.load(..., adapter_path=dir)`. (#362)
- **`mlx-lm` floor raised to >= 0.31.3** (the version the MLX SFT path is built against).
- **`training.seed` reached the SFT wrapper and nothing else (#353).** #341 added the
  knob and wired it into `trainer/sft.py`. The other seventeen task wrappers each build
  their own `TrainingArguments` subclass (`GRPOConfig`, `DPOConfig`, `RewardConfig`, and
  so on) and none of them read the field, so `task: grpo` with `training.seed: 7`
  trained at HF's default of 42 with no error and no warning. Replicates that differed
  only in `training.seed` were therefore the same run, which is what happened to STEP 25
  of the H100 record: its five "replicates" were five runs of seed 42, measured against
  a within-mode spread produced by the very thing it thought it was varying.
  Threading the config is only half the repair. `Trainer.__init__` runs
  `set_seed(args.seed)`, but `get_peft_model` has already drawn `lora_A` by then, and
  `classifier` / `reward_model` / `prm` have already drawn a freshly initialised head
  inside `from_pretrained`, so every wrapper now applies the seed at the top of
  `setup()` as well, before the model is loaded. `unlearn` builds no `Trainer` at all
  and drew its RMU control vector from a generator hard-coded to 0; that draw now
  follows `training.seed`, staying at 0 when the seed is unset so existing runs keep
  their control direction.
  An unset seed still resolves to 42 and leaves `data_seed` at `None`, so the values a
  run trains at are unchanged. What changes is when they arrive. Nothing called
  `set_seed` before `get_peft_model` previously, so `lora_A` was drawn from torch's
  default generator, which is seeded from entropy once per process: an unseeded run's
  adapter and classification-head initialisation varied from one process to the next,
  and it is now deterministic at 42. Replicate variation that came out of runs setting
  no seed was coming from exactly that, so those runs are now identical to each other
  and varying a replicate means setting `training.seed` on purpose. The MLX backend
  (`backend: mlx`) is the one path that still reads neither field.
- **`training.seed` on the MLX backend now says it is ignored (#353, fourth criterion).**
  MLX has its own RNG (`mx.random`) and none of the MLX wrappers touch it, so a seeded
  MLX run was silently unseeded — which looks identical to a seeded one until two
  replicates disagree. That gap only became reachable between #353 being filed and #381
  landing: `backend: mlx` was never dispatched at all until #362 (#363). Setting either
  field now appends to the wrapper's existing "MLX backend ignores:" line, naming
  `training.seed` / `training.data_seed` so it is greppable as written. A warning, not a
  rejection: a config valid on transformers should not become unloadable by switching
  backend. Seeding MLX for real is separate work with a separate RNG.
- **Under `use_fsdp2_compile`, every `checkpoint-*` still loads as a dead adapter
  (#351).** #335's repair runs once, on the output root, after the final `save_model`.
  HF's Trainer writes its periodic checkpoints through that same `save_model` with
  `output_dir=<run>/checkpoint-N`, so they come out carrying `_orig_mod.` on every key
  and nothing ever normalised them. Measured at 70B on 8×H100
  (`benchmarks/gate-h100-validation.md`, STEP 28): 320 canonical keys in the output
  root, **320 prefixed ones in `checkpoint-100`**. Resuming is the case that decides
  how bad this is, and it is worse than #335 was.
  `PeftModel.from_pretrained` at least warns; `Trainer._load_from_checkpoint` calls
  `model.load_adapter(...)` and drops its return value, and `load_adapter` deliberately
  does not warn (it hands the missing keys back in the load result instead, which
  nothing reads), while `load_state_dict(strict=False)` discards the `_orig_mod.` keys
  without a word. A resumed run therefore continues from a re-zeroed `lora_B` in total
  silence: #335's failure shape with its one warning removed. `load_best_model_at_end`
  was reloading a dead adapter for the same reason, since the Trainer restores
  `state.best_model_checkpoint` through that same `load_adapter`, and this repairs that
  path too. Normalising now happens on HF's `on_save`, as each checkpoint is written.
  Both that callback and the final save are gated on `args.should_save`, the condition
  `save_model` writes under, so exactly the rank holding the file repairs it rather
  than all eight opening it at once. The callback is attached in `setup()`, ahead of
  anything a caller adds later: `HFPushCallback.on_save` uploads `checkpoint-{step}` on
  this same event and `CallbackHandler` dispatches in insertion order, so a
  normalisation attached after it would leave `--push-as` publishing the prefixed
  adapter and keeping the repaired one on local disk.
- **A streamed model's `named_parameters()` still carried the wrapper's
  `.inner.` segment, so a name-keyed comparison against a resident model of the same
  checkpoint saw no overlap (#369).** v0.72.1 made `state_dict()` canonical for
  serialisation; this issue is the first time something compared the two model kinds by
  parameter name instead, and the #331 repair gate read the resulting empty intersection
  (`grads exact 0/0`) as a pass. `layer_stream_runtime.canonical_named_parameters()`
  strips `.inner.` the same way `state_dict()` already does, and
  `assert_canonical_parameters_intersect()` raises instead of reporting an empty
  intersection as success. Neither the forward path nor `state_dict()` changed, so the
  v0.72.0 bit-exactness gates remain valid unexercised. `named_modules()` and
  `named_buffers()` carry the same segment and are deliberately not covered — the
  comparison that produced the false green was over parameter names.

### Added

- **`training.stream_vram_override` gives the layer-streaming VRAM pre-flight an
  explicit escape hatch (#347).** `decide_stream_fit` refused any run it predicted
  would not fit, with no way through except lowering `batch_size` or `max_length`.
  Setting this field now replaces the measured free-VRAM figure the pre-flight
  checks against, in either direction: raised past a documented over-prediction to
  let a known-safe config through, or lowered to enforce a cap `mem_get_info()`
  cannot see, such as `set_per_process_memory_fraction` on a shared or capped card
  (a Colab/Kaggle T4, a MIG slice). Rejected at config load when set while
  `stream_layers` is false, mirroring the existing `stream_source`/`stream_buffers`
  footgun gate.

### Fixed

- **A hosted notebook's preinstalled `torchao` made `get_peft_model` raise, and it read as a
  Kadhi bug (#389).** `peft`'s `is_torchao_available()` does not return False on a version it
  considers too old, it **raises `ImportError`** — nine frames inside `get_peft_model`, with
  nothing near the top of the traceback naming `torchao`. Colab preinstalls `torchao` 0.10.0
  against a `peft` that demands newer, so the first `kadhi train` on a free notebook died in a
  place unrelated to anything the user had configured. Now mapped in `utils/errors.py` to the
  cause and the one-line fix (`pip uninstall -y torchao`), with the part worth saying out
  loud: Kadhi does not need `torchao` at all unless `training.quantization_aware` is set.
  Found by running `notebooks/proof-4gb.ipynb` on a real free-tier session, which is the same
  place #385's first repair was caught being a no-op.

- **bf16 was assumed on every CUDA card, so the entire free GPU tier failed (#385, #387).**
  Fourteen places, and only the first was known: `trainer/stream_setup.py` chose the
  layer-streaming store dtype with the literal `"bfloat16" if on_cuda else "float32"` (#385),
  and then a live run found `SFTTrainerWrapper._resolve_mixed_precision` returning
  `(device == "cuda", False)` as its default — and an audit found the same
  `bf16=self.device == "cuda"` in **twelve more wrappers**: bco, classifier, distill, dpo,
  embedding, ipo, kto, online_dpo, orpo, pretrain, reward_model, simpo (#387). So it was not
  a streaming bug at all; **every task** died on that hardware.
  The sharpest detail is that the codebase already knew: `trainer/asr.py` carries the comment
  *"bf16=cuda was hardcoded, which crashes on pre-Ampere cards (T4 / GTX 16xx)"* and fixes it
  — in that one wrapper, never propagated. All fourteen now take the answer from one place,
  `utils/gpu.bf16_fp16_flags`, including ASR, whose private copy was folded in. bf16 needs
  Ampere.
  **Colab's free tier is a T4 (sm_75), Kaggle is a T4 or a P100, and V100 / GTX 16xx / RTX 20xx
  are all pre-Ampere**, so on that hardware Kadhi ran in a dtype the card has no units for.
  Neither could fail on the maintainer's RTX 3050, which is Ampere; this is the same shape as
  the four backends the H100 session found had never executed once.

  **Two corrections to the first version of this entry, both established by finally running
  it on a real T4 rather than reasoning about one.** (1) The claim that every task *died before
  step 0* on transformers' *"Your setup doesn't support bf16/gpu"* was wrong: that error was
  produced by a local stub forcing `is_bf16_supported()` to False, and transformers gates on
  the same permissive call described next, so on the current stack it does not raise at all.
  (2) More seriously, **the first fix was a no-op on the hardware it was written for.**
  `torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported()` defaults to `including_emulation=True`: when its
  compute-capability fast path fails it falls through to merely *constructing* a bf16 tensor,
  which software emulation satisfies — so a T4 answers **True**, and asking the bare question
  selected bf16 exactly as the hardcoded literal had. The predicate now asks
  `is_bf16_supported(including_emulation=False)` (falling back to a capability check on older
  torch), and `get_compute_dtype` — a second copy of the same question — was folded into it.
  What a T4 actually *does* with emulated bf16, as opposed to what it reports, is not yet
  measured.
  **This cannot regress a working setup**: where bf16 is supported the answer is unchanged,
  and where it is not the previous behaviour was a crash. A test SCANS every module in
  `kadhi_cli/trainer/` rather than parametrising over a hand-written list — the list is what
  hid the twelve — and the existing unit test for this line had to be rewritten because it
  asserted the defect (`test_auto_flag_off_preserves_legacy` required bf16 on any CUDA device,
  and passed in CI precisely because CI has no GPU and the old code never asked the driver).
  Correctness of the alternative was measured before the change rather than assumed —
  streamed-vs-resident logits are bit-exact at **0.000000e+00** in float16 as well as
  bfloat16, in *both* quantisations, against resident references of matching numerics (an NF4
  streamed run compared against a genuinely NF4 resident one, since comparing it against a
  bf16 model would measure the dtype rather than the streaming), and the adapter is non-zero.
  **Not yet verified on a pre-Ampere card**: that exactness was measured *using* fp16 on
  Ampere, so it establishes the plumbing, not the Turing/Pascal kernels — the free-tier
  notebook is the natural place to close that.

### Changed

- **Retracted: "layer streaming is bound by host-to-device transfer, not by the GPU."**
  That sentence appeared in the README, in the v0.73.0 notes below, in the H100 gate record
  and in the preprint's abstract. It was an *inference* from the H100 replication — the same
  configuration returning the same throughput on a card with two orders of magnitude more
  compute — and it had never been measured. It was measured on 2026-08-11 on the original
  laptop and is **false at the published configuration**: four interleaved ablation arms in
  one process at a pinned clock show that removing *all* host-to-device traffic (6.864 GB per
  step) buys **1.44%**, removing the NF4 dequantisation buys **9.80%**, and removing both
  leaves **88.7%** of the step; the compute stream is blocked on a copy for 8.4 ms of a
  4190 ms step; and the step runs at **71.3%** of that card's same-session, shape-matched GEMM
  ceiling. The claim *is* true below roughly 128 tokens per step, where the fixed transfer
  volume dominates — the published configuration is not there.
  **No measured number anywhere changes**, and the replication result stands in a weaker form:
  the constraint is common to both machines and is not the compute the datacenter card adds.
  The H100's own bottleneck was never instrumented and no claim is made about it. Record:
  `benchmarks/probe-v0.73.0-what-bounds-streaming.md`. Every occurrence in the gate record and
  in the v0.73.0 notes below is **annotated in place rather than deleted**, because in a folder
  whose whole premise is publishing the record as written, a silent deletion costs more
  credibility than the error does.

### Validation (measured, not changed)

- **Layer streaming completed a run on hardware the maintainer does not own: a free-tier
  Colab Tesla T4 (sm_75, Turing), via [`notebooks/proof-4gb.ipynb`](notebooks/proof-4gb.ipynb).**
  Every streaming number this project has published came from one RTX 3050 Laptop or one
  borrowed 8×H100, and the pre-Ampere fix above (#385, #387) had been verified *using* fp16
  on an Ampere card, which establishes the plumbing and not the Turing kernels. This closes
  that specific gap and nothing wider. `NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`, NF4,
  `stream_layers: true`, `stream_buffers: 2`, batch 1, `max_length: 256`, LoRA r=8/α=16,
  fp16 (a T4 has no bf16 units): 7 steps, exit 0, adapter written with **128 tensors, 128 of
  them non-zero**, and a **measured peak of 2.91 GB** against the pre-flight's predicted
  ~3.02 GB — an over-prediction of **3.8%**, which is the direction the estimator was fitted
  to err in (v0.72.3 fitted it to never under-predict) and is the whole reason it is allowed
  to stop a run. The card has 15.6 GB, so the run was constrained artificially with
  `torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction` to **4.00 GB**, and the cap was shown to bite
  rather than assumed: a deliberate 4.29 GiB allocation was refused. That artificial cap is
  also the reason **no throughput figure is quoted from this run, here or in the notebook** —
  a capped card is not a benchmark, and the panel's own forecast (31–46 tok/s from 2.20 TFLOPS
  measured at 1185 MHz) is a compute bound, not a measurement of what the run did.
  Two things the run did **not** establish, stated because the temptation is to let the exit
  code cover them. **Backward/gradient exactness at 8B on Turing is not shown** — a non-zero
  adapter proves gradients flowed, not that they were right, and the streamed-vs-resident
  comparison in the notebook's section 4 produced **no captured output**, so it is recorded as
  unrun rather than as a pass. And the loss moving 4.5266 → 4.0674 over 7 steps, non-monotonically
  (4.5266, 4.2388, 3.7485, 4.6930, 4.1940, 4.1127, 4.0674), is reported because it is what the
  run printed; over seven steps it is not evidence of learning.
  One observation worth carrying forward: the pre-flight panel reported **free VRAM 15.10 GB**,
  i.e. it read the device and not the per-process cap the run was actually held to, so the fit
  decision was taken against a number 3.8× larger than the budget in force. The run fit on its
  own merits (2.91 GB against 4.00 GB), so nothing was protected by luck — but on that hardware
  the pre-flight is not what would have caught an over-budget config, which is exactly the case
  `training.stream_vram_override` (#347, above) exists for. Record:
  `benchmarks/run-t4-colab-free-tier.md`.

## [0.73.0] - 2026-08-09

**The release that came out of three days on somebody else's hardware.**

Every number this project had ever published was measured on one machine: an RTX 3050
Laptop, 4 GB, Windows. From 5–9 August it ran on a borrowed 8×H100 box (Ubuntu 24.04,
a much newer torch / bitsandbytes / trl / peft stack) for the first time. That found
**one silent correctness defect in layer streaming, four backends that had never
actually run, and a documented multi-GPU entry point that had never launched** — plus
the first evidence that the laptop result reproduces on hardware nothing like it. The
full record, published as written including six rejected hypotheses and three false
positives that controls caught, is
[`benchmarks/gate-h100-validation.md`](benchmarks/gate-h100-validation.md).

This is a **minor** bump, not a v0.72.x patch: it adds two capabilities that did not
exist, and repairs four backends.

### Added

- **`training.seed` and `training.data_seed` (#341).** Every Kadhi run trained at
  seed 42 with no way to change it, so "run this twice with a different seed" was
  impossible. Both default to `None` rather than to `42` on purpose: an unset seed has
  to reproduce **two** different historical defaults — HF's 42 for `TrainingArguments`
  and 0 for the multipack sampler since v0.37.0 — and a plain `42` default would have
  silently re-ordered every existing multipack run.
  **Scope, stated rather than left as a footgun:** wired into the SFT trainer only.
  Other task wrappers build their own `TrainingArguments`, so setting it on a DPO run
  parses and does nothing — tracked as #353.
- **Full fine-tuning as `lora.r: 0` (#340).** The SFT trainer's full-FT branch was
  dead code with no way to reach it. `r: 0` was chosen on repo evidence, not taste:
  three consumers already treat rank 0 as "no adapter", and `r: 0` previously crashed
  inside PEFT, so no config that worked before changes meaning. `lora.r` also gained a
  lower bound — `r: -5` used to parse and die inside PEFT.
- **`--deepspeed zero3_offload`** — ZeRO-3 with CPU parameter offload. `zero3` set
  `offload_param: none` and the only offload *preset* was stage 2, optimizer-only, so
  the configuration a user short of VRAM actually wants could not be named on the
  command line. Measured on one H100 (Llama-3.1-8B, bf16, LoRA r=8, 256 steps):
  **21.65 tok/s at a 38,135 MiB peak**. `offload_optimizer` deliberately stays `none` —
  turning it on makes DeepSpeed JIT-build `cpu_adam` against a matching CUDA toolkit
  and fail without one; copy the emitted JSON and flip it if you have `nvcc`.
- **`trl` support widened to `>=0.14.0,<0.29`** (#326), behind a capability-probe
  compat layer (`trainer/_trl_compat.py`) rather than a version table — a version
  table is what was wrong twice before. The trainers now ask each config class whether
  it accepts `max_prompt_length`, and resolve `ORPOConfig`/`CPOConfig`/`BCOConfig`
  through `trl.experimental` when trl 0.29 drops them from the public namespace. All
  six preference trainers construct **and train to identical losses** on trl 0.26.2,
  0.28.0 and 1.9.2.

### Fixed — backends that had never been run

- **`kadhi train --gpus N` never launched at all (#77).** `accelerate launch` takes a
  script path positionally, and Kadhi handed it `sys.executable` — so accelerate opened
  the Python binary and parsed it as source (`SyntaxError: source code cannot contain
  null bytes`). Every rank died before the trainer existed. The documented multi-GPU
  entry point has been dead since it shipped, invisible to single-GPU CI because that
  path skips the launcher wrapper entirely. Separately, `--no-reexec` printed a command
  with every user flag dropped, so following the hint literally trained without
  `--fsdp`.
- **DeepSpeed could not train a LoRA model on any stage (#336).** HF builds two
  optimizer parameter groups and with LoRA the no-decay group is *empty*; DeepSpeed
  drops it, leaving one group against two `base_lrs`, and torch's scheduler then hits a
  strict-`zip` length mismatch. Verified repaired on 2×H100 with real `kadhi train`:
  zero2 6790.2 tok/s, zero3 1025.3, zero++ 977.1, all exit 0 with a live adapter
  (96/96). `zero++` failed earlier and independently — it set fp16 quantised
  weights/gradients against a bf16 model and hardcoded `zero_hpz_partition_size: 8`
  regardless of the real world size; both are now derived, and the rewrite is printed
  rather than applied silently.
- **`use_fsdp2_compile` wrote an adapter that reloads as all zeros (#335).** Under
  `torch.compile` the Trainer saves *through* the wrapper, so every key came out as
  `_orig_mod.base_model.model...`. The tensors were genuinely trained
  (max|lora_B| 7.0e-3 measured) and `PeftModel.from_pretrained` matched none of them —
  emitting only a `UserWarning` and leaving `lora_B` at its zero init. Measured on
  4×H100: **0 of 96 non-zero** against 96/96 for the paired non-compile run, reproduced
  3/3, with the run exiting 0 throughout.
- **`kadhi serve --backend sglang` returned 500 on every generation (#76).** sglang
  0.5.16's `Runtime.generate` returns a JSON *string*; Kadhi subscripted it as a dict.
  Deterministic, not a race — the backend loaded cleanly and then failed 100% of
  requests. It had genuinely never been run, because SGLang does not support Windows.
- **The vLLM backend ignored the model's chat template (#332).** `utils/vllm.py`
  hand-rolled a `"User: ...\nAssistant:"` prompt while the transformers backend used
  `apply_chat_template`, so every vLLM user's model saw a format it was never trained
  on. On Llama-3.1-8B + LoRA, identical server and sampling params, only the prompt
  differing: a run-on loop burning all 200 tokens **before**, an 8-token answer
  **after**. Both backends now share one `build_chat_prompt`.
- **Three vLLM serving defects (#333)**, each verified live: `finish_reason` was
  hardcoded `"stop"` even at `completion_tokens == max_tokens`; `--dashboard` silently
  no-opped (`/metrics` returned 404 with nothing printed); and `--max-model-len` did not
  exist although the engine factory already accepted it. `--dashboard` on a backend that
  cannot serve it now warns at startup naming the backend instead of doing nothing.

### Fixed — training paths that silently did the wrong thing

- **`data.max_length` was capped at 1024 on every SFT run (#78).** `SFTTrainer`
  converts `TrainingArguments` with `SFTConfig(**args.to_dict())`, and `max_length` is
  an SFT-only field that `TrainingArguments` does not carry — so it always took
  `SFTConfig`'s default. Measured before the fix: `data.max_length=4096` gave 1024
  tokens per sample, with no warning.
- **`training.use_liger: true` crashed at step 0 (#78).** Kadhi patched the model but
  never set `TrainingArguments.use_liger_kernel`, the flag TRL reads to know the fused
  path returns `logits=None`; its entropy metric then ran on `None`. Reproduced across
  the whole supported trl pin, so the feature did not run at all. Separately, Liger's
  architecture match was a *substring of the model name*, so any model loaded from a
  local directory trained without Liger on a flag the user had explicitly set — it now
  reads `AutoConfig.model_type`.
- **FlashAttention 3 was selected from a version that can never report 3 (#334).**
  Dao-AILab ships FA3 as `flash_attn_3`; `flash_attn` itself stays in the 2.x line, so
  the branch could not fire for any real install — and had it fired, it produced an
  `attn_implementation` transformers would reject. On Hopper hardware users silently got
  FA2 or SDPA while the docs advertised FA3. Both detectors now ask transformers.
  This makes detection honest; it does not make FA3 measurable here.

### Fixed — layer streaming

- **A silent wrong-gradient defect on large NF4 models (#331).**
  `bitsandbytes.MatMul4Bit` stashes the packed weight and `quant_state` on `ctx` as
  plain attributes instead of through `save_for_backward`, so gradient checkpointing
  cannot discard and recompute them. The reference is captured in the forward, *aliases
  the streaming buffer pool*, and is read in the backward after that slot has been
  refilled. Result: a bit-exact forward, a healthy-looking loss curve, and wrong
  gradients on every layer but the last `stream_buffers`. It bites NF4 above a threshold
  bracketed at **163.8–171.5 MiB per layer** — so 32B and 72B, never 8B or 14B, and
  never bf16.
  The repair keeps the weight out of that function entirely: dequantise inside the
  checkpointed region and use a native matmul, which saves the dequantised weight
  through the ordinary mechanism. Gated against a resident NF4 reference with a
  repair-disabled control arm in the same process: **real 32B 256/256 gradient tensors
  exact against the control's 8–12/256**, at +2.9% peak VRAM and −4.8% throughput; and
  again on **real 72B — the size where the defect was worst — 320/320 against 8/320**,
  at +2.6% and −3.7%. De-aliasing was measured and rejected first: bnb holds the
  reference across the whole forward-to-backward span, so any copy is O(model), which
  took real 32B from 4,220 to 19,720 MiB and deletes the feature's premise.
- **All four preference losses died on newer trl (#328).**
  `should_enable_hf_gradient_checkpointing` existed so the HF Trainer does not
  checkpoint an already-checkpointed streamed model twice — and only `sft.py` ever
  called it. TRL's default is `False` on trl 0.19.1 and `True` on 0.26.2, so one
  omission had two opposite symptoms: an explicit `gradient_checkpointing: true`
  silently dropped on the older stack, and on the newer one HF checkpointed the *inner*
  decoder layer, recomputed it after the reparametrisation context had exited, and
  killed dpo/orpo/simpo/kto with `Tensor on device cuda:0 is not on the expected
  device meta!`.
- **Layer streaming is now refused when `nn.DataParallel` would engage.** HF wraps the
  model in DataParallel whenever more than one CUDA device is visible and the run is not
  distributed, and DataParallel requires every parameter on `device_ids[0]` — streaming
  keeps the decoder on `meta` by design. It accounted for 8 of the 9 streaming-suite
  failures on the H100 box and is unreachable on a one-GPU machine. It refuses rather
  than quietly using 1 of 8 cards.
- **`device_map="auto"` broke every distributed launch, in fifteen places.**
  transformers refuses `device_map="auto"` outright under a distributed launch, so the
  exact `accelerate launch` command `kadhi train --gpus 8` prints died on every rank. A
  first pass fixed six trainers; nine sites still carried it. All fifteen now go through
  `utils/gpu.resolve_device_map`, and the regression guard scans every module in
  `kadhi_cli/trainer/` instead of a hand-written list — the list is what hid the nine.
- **`LOGITS_BYTES_PER_ELEMENT` is split into two independently measured terms** (#327).
  The 14 is 12 + 2, measured stage by stage on an H100 with zero spread across three
  repeats, and only the 2 differs between stacks. It is deliberately **not lowered** —
  see Known Limitations. What is new is an upward-only calibration
  (`max(14, measured + 2)`), which closes a real unguarded hole: a future stack that
  grew a fourth fp32 buffer would be under-budgeted by 12.5% today with nothing to catch
  it. Default behaviour is byte-identical and the pre-flight path takes no new CUDA.
  (Originally landed as an opt-in probe with no caller; #348 above wires it into the
  pre-flight itself, so it now runs on every streamed run rather than sitting inert.)

### Fixed — eval, ship and export

- **Two of `kadhi ship`'s three behavioural suites measured nothing (#316).** On
  Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, `mini_tool_call` scored **0.000** and `mini_format_json`
  **0.000** on a model that does both correctly. All harness defects: the tool-call
  prompt never told the model tools exist, the JSON check ran `json.loads` over the
  whole output while 38 of 40 answers sit inside a ```` ```json ```` fence, and the
  generation budget was taking `make_generator`'s default of 64, truncating 31 of 40
  tool calls one closing brace short.
- **The refusal detector missed the apostrophe models actually type (#316).** The
  patterns spelled the contraction with U+0027; Llama-3.1 writes U+2019. Over the
  shipped 40-item `mini_safety` suite, **28 of 40 refusals scored as non-refusals** and
  the suite reported 0.300 for a model whose true refusal rate is 1.000 — a 0.70 error
  against a 0.05 regression threshold, i.e. 14× the thing it exists to detect.
- **`kadhi train --task online_dpo` passed a keyword trl removed at 0.25 (#300).** The
  probe asked whether `BasePairwiseJudge` was importable and used the answer to decide
  whether to pass `reward_model=`; those two facts had decoupled, so the probe said yes
  for every trl in the supported range. It now asks the signature — through an MRO walk,
  because on 0.26.2 the top-level class is a deprecation shim whose direct signature
  reports no parameters at all.
- **A quantised GGUF export deleted a previously exported f16 (#144).** The f16
  intermediate was named `{model}.f16.gguf` next to the output — exactly the default
  output name of a `--quant f16` export — and unlinked when quantisation finished. So
  exporting q4_0 destroyed an earlier f16 export, even with an unrelated `--output`.
  Reproduced. It now lives in a private temp directory. Separately, the convert
  dependencies were installed only after an auto-clone, so `--llama-cpp /path` and an
  already-present checkout both died on `ModuleNotFoundError: sentencepiece`.

### Fixed — packaging and docs

- **`requires-python` now has an upper bound: `>=3.10,<3.13` (#358).** CI tests 3.10,
  3.11 and 3.12 and nothing above. Without a ceiling, pip on 3.13+ resolved torch wheels
  nobody here has run, and the failure was not a Kadhi error message — it was a loader
  crash inside `c10.dll` / `libc10.so` before any Kadhi code executed, leaving the user
  nothing to act on. The bound is **3.13, not 3.14**: 3.13 is equally untested.
  `tests/test_requires_python_bound.py` derives the bound from the CI matrix, so
  widening one without the other fails the suite.
- **The `trl` bounds shipped in v0.72.4 were wrong at both ends**, and were corrected
  before #326 widened them again. The ceiling was over-tight by five releases: the
  v0.72.4 table read a `trl/experimental/` *relocation* as a field removal. The floor
  `>=0.7.0` was impossible — `setup()` imports `GRPOTrainer`, first exported at 0.14.0.
  One detail in the v0.72.4 note was also imprecise: `ORPOConfig`/`CPOConfig` are not
  deleted at 0.29, they leave the public namespace — an `ImportError` rather than a
  rejected keyword, which is worse, not milder.
- **The layer-streaming pre-flight panel was titled after a flag that does not exist**
  (#329). It read `kadhi train --stream-layers`; there is no such option — streaming is
  enabled by `training.stream_layers` in `kadhi.yaml`. It is the first thing a streaming
  run prints, so it was the feature's most-read line of documentation, and it pointed at
  a `No such option`.
- **Seven of the eight configs in `examples/configs/` did not parse.** They were written
  against a pre-nesting schema, so `kadhi train --config examples/configs/sft_basic.yaml`
  — the first command `examples/README.md` tells you to run — failed validation. Also
  fixed while there: two configs declared `format: sharegpt` for preference-shaped data
  (a silently wrong training run, not an error), `target_modules` listed `out_proj`
  which no Llama has, and `vision_llama.yaml` pointed at files that have never existed
  in this repo. `tests/test_examples_configs.py` now parses every one of them.
- **`kadhi data demo` metadata described files other than the ones it ships.**
  `sharegpt_demo` declared `format: sharegpt` for prompt/chosen/rejected rows — the
  value a user copies straight into `data.format` — and `grpo_demo` declared
  `reasoning`, which is not in the schema's format literal at all.
- **Encoding corruption in `pyproject.toml`** (fourteen em-dashes round-tripped through
  cp1251, one of them in the `unit` pytest marker description that `pytest --markers`
  prints), and **`docs/commands.md`**, where missing newlines collapsed five commands
  onto two lines and the page promised "the full command list" while omitting seven.

### Changed — documentation corrected against measurement

- **LISA delivers the quality half of its claim, not the memory half (#306).** Measured
  at 3B and 8B on an H100 with LISA engagement verified three independent ways: it beats
  full fine-tuning at both learning rates, and it is **1.22× LoRA's VRAM at 3B and 1.51×
  at 8B**, with the gap *widening* with scale — embeddings, LM head and final norm stay
  trainable every interval and are 70.7% of everything LISA trains at 8B. The docs now
  say that plainly, and say when LISA is still the right choice.
- **FlashAttention and Liger were measured for the first time**, at **1.015×** and
  **1.051× / −12.9% VRAM**, against documented claims of "2–4×" and "20–60% / 20–40%".
  Both claims are corrected in the docs.
- **The GEMM-ceiling test could not pass on a datacenter GPU.** Its plausibility bound
  was `< 200 TFLOPS`, written when the only hardware this project had was an RTX 3050;
  an H100 returns a correct 786.5 TFLOPS and the assertion fired.

### Validation (measured, not changed)

- **The laptop result reproduces on completely different hardware.** Llama-3.1-8B NF4:
  119.6 tok/s in a 3.32 GB peak on the RTX 3050 against a **median 113.00 tok/s in the
  same 3.32 GB** on an H100 — first outside evidence that the method is bound by
  host-to-device transfer, not by the GPU. (See Known Limitations for what the laptop
  figure does and does not now mean.)
  > **Correction, 2026-08-13, left in place rather than rewritten.** The measurement
  > stands; the explanation does not. "Bound by host-to-device transfer" was an inference,
  > never a measurement, and a probe on 2026-08-11 refuted it at the published
  > configuration — deleting every host-to-device byte buys 1.4% and the step runs at 71.3%
  > of the card's same-session GEMM ceiling
  > (`benchmarks/probe-v0.73.0-what-bounds-streaming.md`). What survives is the weaker
  > claim: the constraint is common to both machines and is not the compute the H100 adds.
- **Forward bit-exactness at real model sizes**, not just on toys: logits `torch.equal`
  against a resident reference of matching numerics at 0.5B, 8B, 14B, 32B and 72B. Every
  previously published bit-exactness result was on 3-layer from-config checkpoints,
  because a 4 GB card cannot hold a resident 8B to compare against. *Backward*
  exactness is a separate claim measured separately — see #331 above and the per-model
  ledger at the top of the gate record.
- **A streamed model is as good as a resident one.** Paired over five disjoint training
  subsets and judged by Kadhi's own `kadhi ship`: mean difference **+0.006 against an
  identical 0.013 within-arm spread**, in bf16; **+0.0053 against spreads of 0.0333 and
  0.0200** in NF4. This had never been measured anywhere in the project.
- **Against DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 CPU offload**, same box, same data, same model:
  **2.93× the throughput at 9.7× less peak VRAM** at matched numerics. The honest
  reading is narrow, and the same session establishes it: eight cards of ZeRO-3 are
  *slower* than one card training resident for a model that fits. Layer streaming is
  not "faster than DeepSpeed" — it is for the case where the one card you have is too
  small.

### Known limitations

- **The `training.seed` knob reaches the SFT trainer only** (#353). Every other task
  builds its own `TrainingArguments`; setting it there parses and does nothing.
- **A resident 4-bit run is still not bit-reproducible from a seed** (#354), while a
  streamed one is. `get_peft_model` builds `lora_A` *before* `Trainer.__init__` calls
  `set_seed`, so the adapter init escapes the seed. Diagnosed with three competing
  hypotheses each killed by a control; the one-line fix is verified in the gate record
  but **not shipped here**. It has a real consequence for `kadhi ship`: three runs of one
  unchanged resident config moved `mini_common_sense` by 0.375 and `mini_mmlu` by 0.269
  against a `forgetting_threshold` of 0.05, so five of seven suites can cross the
  regression line on a re-run that changed nothing.
- **The layer-streaming VRAM pre-flight still over-predicts** (#327), and
  `LOGITS_BYTES_PER_ELEMENT` was deliberately left at 14 rather than lowered to the
  measured loss-path value. The asymmetry decides it: over-predicting refuses a config
  that would have worked — visible, annoying, data intact. Under-predicting on Linux is
  a clean OOM, but on **Windows/WDDM there is no exception at all** — it silently spills
  to host memory (measured: 9.27 GB allocated on a 4.29 GB card with nothing raised) and
  the claim "peak is bounded by one layer" quietly stops being true. The counterfactual
  settles it: 14 under-predicts 0 of 10 measured rows (worst +0.85% over), the lower
  value under-predicts 10 of 10 (worst −10.49%). The practical cost is that a streamed
  DPO run is refused from `max_length: 768` on a 4 GB card.
- **`bitsandbytes` still has the defect #331 works around.** Kadhi no longer sends
  streamed NF4 weights through `MatMul4Bit`, but the underlying library behaviour —
  saving tensors outside `save_for_backward` where checkpointing cannot see them — is
  upstream and unchanged. Filed as
  [bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes#2034](https://github.com/bitsandbytes-foundation/bitsandbytes/issues/2034).
- **DeepSpeed + LoRA is repaired in `sft.py` only** (#336). The other trainer wrappers
  still hit the empty-parameter-group failure under DeepSpeed, a user-supplied
  `--deepspeed my.json` is passed through unresolved, and ZeRO++ hierarchical
  partitioning is unit-tested but never exercised across two nodes.
- **`utils/sglang.py` still has both of the defects the vLLM rewrite fixed** — its own
  hand-rolled prompt and a hardcoded `finish_reason`. Named rather than silently
  skipped.
- **The closed-loop reward-hacking controller's mechanism is confirmed; its efficacy is
  not** (#286). At 7B the between-mode difference of 0.130 sits *inside* the within-mode
  spread of 0.140–0.195. Settling it needs ≥5 seeds per mode.
- **Two `kadhi ship` leg-2 suites have scoring gaps that outrank capability** (#346,
  #357). `mini_tool_call` ranks by brace hygiene — Llama-3.1-8B names the right tool
  40/40 and scores 0.225 — and `mini_mmlu` loses 8 of 26 items because
  `extract_mcq_letter` does not know `\boxed{C}`, scoring the 8B at 0.423, below a 0.5B.
  Adding that one form takes it to 0.731 and the inversion disappears. A third
  suspected inversion (#356) was **withdrawn as a measurement error of our own** — it
  was measured at a 64-token budget where `kadhi ship` uses 256.
- **The 70B FSDP2 recipe could not be smoke-tested** (#41): it needs all eight cards, so
  it could not be parallelised with anything else in the session.
- **The RAM-vs-disk streaming throughput gap remains unmeasured** (#325), and layer
  streaming remains **BETA**.

### A note on the preprint

[DOI 10.5281/zenodo.21771064](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21771064) is unaffected in
its correctness claims: its configuration is 8B NF4 at **105 MiB per layer**, comfortably
below the 163.8–171.5 MiB boundary of #331, and it survives a 50-backward soak at
`worst_abs = 0.0`. What this release changes is **scope**, not validity — exactness moves
from 3-layer from-config toys to resident references at 8B / 14B / 32B / 72B. A version 2
of the record carrying the H100 validation, the resident references, the DeepSpeed
comparison and the disclosed defect is in preparation.

One number should be read with a caveat: **the published 119.6 tok/s laptop figure was
measured before the #331 repair and has not been re-run on repaired code.** The repair
cost −4.8% throughput at 32B, so treat the laptop figure as a pre-repair number until
someone re-measures it on an RTX 3050. An H100 cannot substitute — the whole point of the
H100 result is that this method is transfer-bound, so its throughput does not carry across
machines.

> **Correction, 2026-08-13.** The conclusion holds, the reason given for it does not: the
> laptop is not transfer-bound (see the correction above). An H100 still cannot substitute,
> for a narrower reason — the repair's cost is paid in the per-layer NF4 dequantisation,
> measured at 9.8% of the step on the laptop, and that share belongs to that card's clock,
> GEMM ceiling and launch overhead.

## [0.72.4] - 2026-08-03

**Added — preference losses over layer streaming: DPO, ORPO, SimPO and KTO.**

Layer streaming kept the frozen base in CPU RAM and fed it to the GPU one decoder
layer at a time, but only for `task: sft`. This release opens it to the four
preference losses. The whole risk was one thing: **DPO needs a reference model, and a
second model instance would double memory and defeat the feature entirely.**

- **The reference is the same streamed base with its adapters disabled** — one set of
  weights, one stream, no second pass. Measured on an RTX 3050 4 GB with a 730 MB
  model: streamed DPO peaked at **0.914x** the SFT peak, with a byte-identical RAM
  store and buffer pool. Forcing a real second instance in the same harness cost
  **+730.44 MB against 730.44 MB of weights** — exactly one copy. That control is what
  makes the first number mean something.
- **KTO is *not* reference-free**, contrary to how it is usually described: it selects
  its reference exactly the way DPO does, so it gets the same treatment and the same
  memory assertion. ORPO and SimPO genuinely are reference-free.
- **Bit-exact against a resident run of the same loss** — `0.0` difference for all
  four, the standard every slot in this series inherits.
- **The pre-flight now knows that a paired loss is twice the rows.** DPO, ORPO and
  SimPO concatenate chosen and rejected into one tensor, so a VRAM budget computed at
  one row per example would have under-predicted by half — and on Windows the
  consequence is not an error but a silent spill to host memory that makes the run an
  order of magnitude slower.
- **KTO requires `batch_size >= 2`** (its KL term is degenerate at 1). Kadhi now says so
  when your config is read, rather than minutes later after sharding the checkpoint.
  KTO is streamable at all only because v0.72.3 lifted the batch-1 restriction.
- **`grpo` and `ppo` remain excluded permanently**, not "not yet": generation rollouts
  re-read every layer once per generated token, which destroys the amortisation
  streaming depends on. The refusal says so and deliberately names no release.

The streaming setup now lives in one shared place instead of being copied per trainer,
so the NF4 pre-flight, the RAM/disk tier choice and the VRAM fit refusal cannot drift
between SFT and the preference losses.

**Fixed — `trl` is now capped, and that is a real bug fix, not a CI tweak.**
Six trainers (`bco`, `dpo`, `ipo`, `kto`, `orpo`, `simpo`) pass `max_prompt_length` to
their `trl` config, and `trl` removed it in stages. So anyone who ran
`pip install 'kadhi-cli[train]'` and resolved to a recent `trl` had
`kadhi train --task orpo` fail on import.

> **Correction (see [0.73.0]).** This release shipped the cap as `<0.25` on the
> strength of a staged-removal table that was itself wrong. The real stages are
> `kto` at 0.27, `bco`/`orpo`/`simpo` at 0.28 and `dpo`/`ipo` at 0.29. v0.73.0 first
> corrected the cap to `<0.27` and then raised it to `<0.29` behind a capability-probe
> compat layer, so the trainers no longer set the cap at all.

That was already true before this release and nothing caught it: the `trl` imports
live inside `setup()`, which no test had ever called on those wrappers, so CI stayed
green while the code only worked on older `trl`. This release's end-to-end preference
tests are what surfaced it.

The boundary was read off the published wheels per config rather than inferred from a
version number — the removal being staged is exactly why a single spot-check gives the
wrong answer, and see the correction above for how that method can still land on the
wrong answer. Supporting the newer API is its own piece of work; declaring a dependency
the code actually works with comes first.

Honest costs: streaming makes the reference free in **memory**, not in **time** — DPO
traverses the layer stack three times per step against SFT's two, measured at **1.52x**
the layer reads. And the VRAM pre-flight is a sound *upper* bound for preference
losses rather than a tight estimate; see Known Limitations in the release notes.

## [0.72.3] - 2026-07-28

**Added — layer streaming breadth: more architectures, bigger batches, resume, and a
disk tier.**

Layer streaming (v0.72.0–.2) was deliberately narrow: Llama/Qwen only, batch 1, no
gradient accumulation, no resume, RAM only. This release lifts all of it, and each
capability was gated against a streamed-vs-resident bit-exactness reference before any
of it was written.

- **Six more model families.** `mistral`, `gemma`, `gemma2`, `gemma3_text`, `phi` and
  `phi3` join the allowlist, each verified **bit-exact** against the same checkpoint
  loaded resident, under both bf16 and NF4. Phi-3 is the notable one: it fuses Q/K/V
  into a single `qkv_proj`, so there is no `q_proj` to find, and it is bit-exact anyway.
  Multimodal `gemma3` is deliberately *not* accepted — only `gemma3_text`.
- **`batch_size` above 1, and gradient accumulation.** Both previously refused.
- **A pre-flight VRAM budget that accounts for batch and vocabulary.** Streaming bounds
  the *weights*; activations and the logits tensor are untouched by it and both scale
  with `batch × seq`. On a 152k-vocab model at batch 8 the logits term alone measured
  **8.71 GB — 146× the entire layer-buffer pool**. `kadhi train` now predicts peak VRAM
  and refuses a run that will not fit, naming the two knobs that scale it.
- **A throughput forecast**, quoted as a range from a GEMM ceiling measured on your own
  card in that session, alongside the SM clock — never a compiled-in per-card constant.
- **`--resume` and `--hf-resume` work with streaming.**
- **A disk overflow tier.** `stream_source: auto` (the default) uses RAM when the base
  fits and falls back to an NVMe disk tier when it does not, holding nothing resident.
  `stream_source: ram` refuses instead of falling back. Non-NVMe disks are still
  refused outright.
- **`kadhi doctor --disk`** reports the detected media type.

**Fixed**

- `estimate_logits_bytes` charged 6 bytes per logit element; the measured peak is **14**
  (`transformers` holds the bf16 logits, the fp32 upcast, log-softmax's fp32 output and
  the fp32 gradient live at once). The old figure under-predicted that term by 2.33×.
- Adapters could not be loaded *into* a streamed model: `load_state_dict` narrows keys
  by child name, so a canonical checkpoint matched **0 of N** tensors and PEFT reported
  only a warning — a resumed run reproduced the from-scratch loss curve exactly. The
  streaming layer now redirects canonical keys at load time, mirroring the v0.72.1
  save-side fix.
- The NVMe-only tier guard was wired to a hardcoded constant and could never fire.
- Streaming weight sources are now released when training ends **or raises**; the disk
  tier holds one open shard handle per decoder layer.
- Subprocess helpers resolve tools to absolute paths (on Windows, `CreateProcess`
  searches the current directory before `PATH`).
- The `[mcp]` extra is now capped at `mcp<2`. The SDK's 2.0.0 release removed
  `mcp.shared.memory.create_connected_server_and_client_session` and dropped
  `Server.list_tools`, breaking `kadhi mcp serve`'s round-trip tests for anyone
  installing fresh. Support for the 2.x API is tracked separately.

**Known limitations**

- The **RAM-vs-disk performance gap is unmeasured** on the development hardware and no
  number is claimed for it. safetensors memory-maps the shards, so the OS page cache
  keeps them resident between steps on a machine with spare RAM, and at ~5 effective
  TFLOPS the NVMe read hides under compute. The disk tier's *correctness* is verified
  bit-exact against the RAM tier; its speed relative to RAM is not characterised.
- End-to-end `kadhi train --resume` could not be demonstrated on the development box:
  `transformers` refuses `torch.load` below torch 2.6 (CVE-2025-32434), which blocks
  **every** resume there, streaming or not. The streaming-specific half — the adapter
  round-trip and loss continuity — is verified on the production CUDA path.
- Loading *into* a streamed model works; `named_parameters()` and `state_dict()` still
  disagree in memory, which is the deliberate cost of a serialisation-only design.
- Layer streaming remains **BETA**.

## [0.72.2] - 2026-07-28

**Added — NF4 layer streaming: fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B on a 4 GB laptop GPU.**

Layer streaming (v0.72.0) keeps the frozen base in CPU RAM and streams it to the
GPU one decoder layer at a time, so peak VRAM is bounded by one layer instead of
the whole model. It was bf16-only, which capped it at about 3B on a small card.
Quantising the streamed base to NF4 shrinks it ~4×, and that is what brings 8B
within reach.

Add one line to a streaming config:

```yaml
training:
  stream_layers: true
  quantization: 4bit    # NF4
  batch_size: 1
```

**Measured on a 4 GB RTX 3050 Laptop** (Windows, batch 1, S=512, gradient
checkpointing, 50 steps after 10 warm-up, `PagedAdamW8bit`):

| Model | tok/s | Peak VRAM | RAM store | GPU util |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct | 119.6 | 3.32 GB | 3.60 GB (page-locked) | 100% |
| Qwen2.5-3B | 264.2 | 1.76 GB | 1.43 GB (page-locked) | 100% |

For scale: 1M training tokens is about 2.3 h at 8B on that card (arithmetic from
the measured rate, not a separate measurement).

Qwen2.5-3B also got **1.85× faster** than the bf16 streaming path (264.2 vs
143.1 tok/s) — and the reason is not arithmetic. A 1.43 GB store fits under the
machine's page-locked memory ceiling where a 5.55 GB one did not, which restores
asynchronous host-to-device copies and lifts GPU utilisation from 79.3% to 100%.

**Correctness.** A streamed NF4 run is **bit-exact** against a resident NF4 run:
the same quantised bytes through the same bitsandbytes kernels. Logit equality,
non-zero gradients at layer 0, and a matching multi-step loss curve are all
regression tests, not one-off measurements.

The base is quantised once, offline, and cached under `~/.kadhi/layer-stream/`.
The cache is keyed to the quantisation *and* the source checkpoint, so switching
between `none` and `4bit`, or retraining a base in place, re-shards instead of
silently streaming the wrong bytes.

**Fixed — a streamed 4-bit run reported its parameter count ~6.5× too high.**
SmolLM2-135M printed "878,154,048 total" (true: 134,515,008). Display only —
training was unaffected — but at 8B it would have read ~52 B.

Scope is unchanged and still BETA: RAM tier, `task: sft`, Llama/Qwen,
`batch_size: 1`, no gradient accumulation, no `--resume`. Every rejected config
names the release that lifts it. `quantization` values other than `none` and
`4bit` are refused.

**Fixed — `kadhi --help` was 5x slower than it should be.** Since v0.72.0 the CLI
imported PyTorch on startup, taking **6.0 s** where it now takes **1.15 s**.

`kadhi reward stress` (v0.71.41) put `utils/reward_stress` on the light CLI path.
That module imported `utils/reward_hack_control` to reuse a single string
constant — and `reward_hack_control` resolves its `TrainerCallback` base class at
module scope, which pulls in `transformers` and `torch`. Importing a ~4.4 s
dependency for one constant made every `kadhi` invocation pay for the training
stack, including commands that never touch a model.

Nothing produced wrong results; this was purely startup latency. The light core
(`pip install kadhi-cli` without the `[train]` extra) was never broken — it fell
back cleanly when torch was absent, just slowly when it was present.

Added `tests/test_cli_startup_is_light.py`, which asserts the invariant at
runtime (`import kadhi_cli.cli` must not put `torch` in `sys.modules`) instead of
inspecting source text for `import torch`, which is what the previous guards did
and why this went unnoticed.

## [0.72.1] - 2026-07-27

**Fixed — layer-streaming adapters were saved in an unloadable form.** If you
trained with `stream_layers: true` on v0.72.0, the adapter that run wrote is
**inert**: every tensor was saved under a key containing an extra `.inner.`
segment, so `kadhi merge`, `kadhi serve`, `kadhi chat` and
`PeftModel.from_pretrained` all loaded **zero** adapter tensors and silently
returned the untuned base model. PEFT emitted only a `UserWarning`, so nothing
failed and nothing looked wrong.

The training itself was correct — the streamed run's numerics are unaffected,
and v0.72.0's bit-exactness results still stand. Only the saved file was
affected.

**If you have a v0.72.0 streamed adapter: re-save or re-run it on v0.72.1.**
There is no way to recover the original file's association with the base model
beyond renaming its keys; re-running is the reliable path. A quick check —
if `adapter_model.safetensors` contains keys with `.inner.` in them, it is
affected:

```bash
python -c "from safetensors.torch import load_file; \
print([k for k in load_file('adapter_model.safetensors') if '.inner.' in k][:3])"
```

Streamed adapters now save byte-for-byte in the same layout as an ordinary LoRA
run, and are portable to any tool that has never heard of layer streaming.

**Also fixed — `--hf-resume` bypassed the streaming resume refusal.** The guard
only tested `--resume`, but `--hf-resume` reaches `resume_from` through a
different branch. That combination previously appeared to work by accident
(checkpoint and live model shared the same key shape); once adapters are saved
canonically it would instead have matched *nothing* and continued with a
freshly initialised adapter, silently. Both flags are now refused for streaming
runs, naming v0.72.3.

Also in this release: every "this lands in vX.Y.Z" refusal message was corrected
after the v0.72.x roadmap was renumbered (NF4 streaming is now v0.72.2; the disk
tier, wider architectures, larger batches, gradient accumulation and
checkpoint/resume are v0.72.3; preference losses are v0.72.4).

**Known limitation:** in memory the streamed model's `named_parameters()` still
carries the wrapper segment, so loading *into* a streaming run (`--resume`)
remains unsupported and is refused with a message naming v0.72.3.

## [0.72.0] - 2026-07-26

> **Superseded by v0.72.1 — adapters saved by this version load as zero
> tensors.** The entry below is left as published; the defect and the fix are
> described under [0.72.1]. Version numbers named as "upcoming" below were also
> renumbered there (NF4 is v0.72.2, not v0.72.1).

**Layer streaming (BETA) — fine-tune models that don't fit in your card.** The
frozen base lives in CPU RAM and is streamed into two pre-allocated VRAM buffers
one decoder layer at a time, so peak VRAM is bounded by the size of *one layer*
instead of the whole model. Only the LoRA adapters, their gradients and
optimizer state stay resident. Slower than resident training — but these models
did not run on the card at all.

Measured on the development box (**RTX 3050 Laptop 4 GB**, Windows 11, 16.9 GB
RAM), batch 1, gradient checkpointing on, 50 steps after 10 warm-up:

| Model | S | tok/s | GPU util | Peak VRAM |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-0.5B | 512 | 978.6 | 91.4% | 1.47 GB |
| Qwen2.5-1.5B | 512 | 525.0 | 96.8% | 1.82 GB |
| Qwen2.5-1.5B | 1024 | 487.6 | 96.7% | 2.96 GB |
| Qwen2.5-3B | 512 | 143.1 | 79.3% | **2.15 GB** |

**Qwen2.5-3B trains in 2.15 GB on a 4 GB card where a resident run OOMs.** The
honest cost: **1.43× slower than resident**, measured at 0.5B — the only
apples-to-apples comparison available on this box, because 1.5B and above cannot
run resident here at all.

### Added

- **`training.stream_layers: true`** — stream the frozen base layer-by-layer
  from CPU RAM. `training.stream_source` (`auto`/`ram`/`disk`) and
  `training.stream_buffers` (2–8, default 2 = double buffering) tune it.
- `kadhi_cli/utils/layer_stream.py` — tier choice, pinned-vs-pageable decision,
  architecture allowlist, VRAM/throughput arithmetic (no torch import).
- `kadhi_cli/utils/layer_shard.py` — rewrites an HF checkpoint into one
  safetensors shard per decoder layer, one tensor at a time, so sharding a model
  that does not fit never needs it to fit.
- `kadhi_cli/utils/layer_stream_runtime.py` — buffer pool, CPU-RAM weight source,
  prefetch scheduler on a dedicated CUDA stream, and the streamed layer wrapper.
- Shards are cached under `~/.kadhi/layer-stream/` (override with
  `KADHI_LAYER_STREAM_CACHE_DIR`) and keyed to the source checkpoint's
  fingerprint, so a base retrained in place re-shards instead of silently
  training against stale weights.
- When the base cannot be page-locked, the RAM store falls back to pageable
  memory **and says so**, including the measured cost (GPU utilisation
  ~97% → ~79%).

### Changed

- The pre-flight hardware-fit gate is skipped for streaming runs: it models a
  resident run and would otherwise refuse exactly the runs streaming enables.
- Gradient checkpointing is handled per-layer by the streamer; the HF Trainer's
  own is left off so layers are not recomputed twice.

### Known limitations

- **BETA, and proof-of-mechanism at 3B.** Nothing above 3B was measured. No
  8B/14B claim is supported.
- Scope: RAM tier, bf16, `task: sft`, Llama/Qwen, batch size 1, no gradient
  accumulation, no `--resume`. Every refusal names the release that lifts it.
- 4-bit (NF4) streaming is **v0.72.1** — NF4 weights carry a quantisation state
  and cannot be byte-copied into a plain buffer.
- The disk overflow tier, larger batches, gradient accumulation and
  checkpoint/resume are **v0.72.2**.
- The 3B number used a **pageable** store (this box cannot page-lock 5.55 GB),
  so it is a lower bound.
- `expandable_segments:True` is silently ignored on Windows; Kadhi detects this
  and does not claim it is active.
- Numbers are Windows/WDDM and therefore systematically pessimistic vs Linux.

## [0.71.41] - 2026-07-19

**`kadhi reward stress`: is your reward verifier gameable?** Turn the reward-hacking
detector on the *verifier itself*. `kadhi reward synth` (v0.71.40) proves a verifier
separates your references from friendly perturbations; `stress` asks the adversarial
question a reward-hacking model asks at train time — *does the verifier pay out for
degenerate junk?* It feeds empty, length-padded, repetition, and sentinel-spam
completions and flags any the verifier accepts. Pure, offline, exit 0 = robust /
2 = gameable / 1 = error. Nothing in TRL / Unsloth / Axolotl / OpenRLHF tests a
verifier for gameability.

### Added

- **`kadhi reward stress <reward.py|builtin> [--references golds.jsonl]`** — adversarial
  verifier probe. Attacks (`--attacks empty,length,repetition,sentinel`, `--sentinel`)
  are scored against the real gold, so numeric / tool_call / json_schema verifiers get a
  valid target and still must reject the junk. Reports a per-attack accept-rate table +
  an overall gameability verdict (`--max-gameable`, `--threshold`, `--output-report`).
  Loads the target through the existing reward loader, so it probes a synthesized `.py`
  **and** a builtin (`accuracy` / `format` / `verifiable`). A gold-requiring verifier
  probed with no `--references` is a hard error, never a false "robust".

### Fixed

- Corrected the Telemetry section in the ops docs: Kadhi's telemetry primitives exist but
  are **not wired to any command** — no data is ever sent today (the previous wording
  implied a live opt-in sender). Wiring is deferred until a public privacy policy ships.

## [0.71.40] - 2026-07-19

**`kadhi reward synth`: auto-generate a deterministic reward verifier from your data.**
Point it at a JSONL of reference (gold) outputs and it infers a verifier, emits a
readable / committable `.py` reward function, and — the moat — *refuses* to emit one
that can't tell your references from auto-generated bad answers. Nothing in
TRL / Unsloth / Axolotl / OpenRLHF synthesizes a reward; every reward today is
hand-written, hand-picked, or a trained-weights artifact.

### Added

- **`kadhi reward synth <references.jsonl> -o reward.py`** — deterministic verifier
  synthesis. Four families, auto-detected (or pick with `--kind`): `numeric`
  (last-number / `\boxed{}` / `####` extraction, exact or `--tolerance`), `json_schema`
  (induced keys + types + required), `regex` (positional char-classes over
  equal-length golds), `tool_call` (per-tool `required`/`allowed` argument binding).
  The emitted file is self-contained and rides `load_reward_fn`'s existing `.py`
  path — no new trusted-exec surface; you read, edit, commit, and diff it.
- **Mandatory calibration report** — the synthesized verifier is loaded back and run
  against its own references (must accept ≥90%) and auto-perturbed negatives (must
  reject). A degenerate always-accept verifier is **refused** (`exit 2`), never
  silently emitted. `--plan-only` reports the induced spec without writing;
  `--output-report` persists the calibration JSON.
- **Comma-separated `reward_fn` (`"accuracy,format"`)** now trains — it resolves to a
  reward *ensemble* (`GRPOTrainer(reward_funcs=[...])`, and unlocks the `rm_ensemble`
  reward-hack detector which needs ≥2 rewards). GRPO-only, validated at config-parse
  time. Fixes a recipe (`deepseek-v3-reasoning`) that shipped exactly this and
  previously crashed with `Unknown reward function` (#311).

### Changed / Fixed

- `training.reward_fn` gains a field validator (null-byte / blank / oversize /
  empty-comma-segment rejection) — the oldest arbitrary-code field was the least
  guarded. Comma + `verifiable` without a `verifiable_domain` now fails at parse
  time like the bare `verifiable` form.
- `envs/calculator.py` / `envs/guess_number.py` docstrings corrected: the reward is
  `reward_fn: verifiable` + `verifiable_domain: math` (the bare `reward_fn='math'`
  they showed was never valid).

## [0.71.39] - 2026-07-19

**"CI for weights, not prompts": close the evidence loop.** `kadhi ship`'s verdict is
now something Kadhi can emit, commit, review, and bind to the exact model that
produced it — turning the `kadhi ci init` gate from "edit two numbers in a JSON file"
into a reproducible, provenance-bound check that renders on every PR.

### Added

- **`kadhi ship --emit-evidence <path>`** — re-serialises the verdict into the
  `--evidence` INPUT schema, so a run's output is replayable as input: feeding it
  back through `--evidence` (same `--forgetting-threshold`) reproduces an identical
  verdict. Output is finally input.
- **`ShipConfig` under `eval.ship` in `kadhi.yaml` + `kadhi ship --config kadhi.yaml`** —
  commit the gate policy (`task_eval` / `task_mode` / `general_suite` /
  `forgetting_threshold` / `judge_model` / `baseline`) so the verdict is reviewable in
  a PR diff and reproducible. An explicit CLI flag always wins (CLI > config > default).
- **`kadhi ship --push owner/repo#N`** — post the verdict as a GitHub PR comment
  (reuses the `kadhi adapters pr --push` `gh api` plumbing). Best-effort: a missing
  token / `gh` failure warns but never flips the SHIP / DON'T-SHIP exit code.
- **Evidence provenance + staleness gate.** With `--emit-evidence`, `--config` STAMPS
  a `provenance` block (`config_sha` — a semantic, order-insensitive recipe hash — plus
  `base_model` and a best-effort `data_sha`) onto the evidence. With `--evidence`
  alone, `--config` GATES: it refuses (exit 3) evidence whose `config_sha` drifted
  from the committed config, so a PR that changed `kadhi.yaml` but forgot to recompute
  its evidence is caught. The gate policy (`eval.ship`) is EXCLUDED from the hash, so
  tuning `forgetting_threshold` never falsely invalidates evidence about an unchanged
  model.
- **`kadhi ci init --config <kadhi.yaml>`** — binds the generated gate's `kadhi ship`
  step to the committed config (provenance/staleness enforcement in CI).

### Changed

- **Exit-code note:** `kadhi ship --config` usage / staleness errors are exit `3`
  (usage), preserving `0 = SHIP`, `2 = DON'T SHIP`, `1 = runtime` from v0.71.38.

### Security

- `provenance.config_sha` read from untrusted evidence is shape-validated as a hex
  digest before being echoed (a raw value could smuggle terminal ESC bytes past
  `rich.markup.escape`).
- `provenance.data_sha` hashes the training file through an `O_NOFOLLOW` fd with a
  symlink-rejecting containment check and an 8 GiB cap (was an unguarded `hash_file`).
- `kadhi ci init`'s path validation now rejects `#` and the YAML 1.1 line breaks
  (NEL / LS / PS), closing a plain-scalar comment-truncation of the generated `run:`
  step (also hardens the pre-existing `--data` / `--suite` / `--evidence` args).

## [0.71.38] - 2026-07-17

**`kadhi ship`'s regression leg now has teeth.** Leg 2 (the catastrophic-forgetting
/ regression gate that carries the whole SHIP / DON'T-SHIP claim) was 15
hand-written trivia prompts scored by case-insensitive **substring** containment
— it scored `"B"` for "**B**erlin", `"ok"` for "lo**ok**", `"3"` for "1**3**", and
had **zero** items for tool-calling, safety, or JSON validity. This release makes
the gate real: a fixed, extraction-based scorer + bundled, offline, zero-dep eval
suites that catch a regression the old gate waved through.

### Changed

- **Fixed answer scorer (breaking — verdicts can change).** `kadhi ship`'s leg-2
  MCQ / instruction / arithmetic answers are now scored by answer-**extraction**
  + a boundary-aware match, replacing the raw substring test. A spurious
  substring inside another word ("Berlin", "look", "13") no longer scores a
  correct answer, so an existing run's verdict may flip — intentionally, because
  the old gate was reporting false negatives.
- **Bundled, offline general suite.** The default `--general-suite` is now seven
  hand-authored suites shipped in the wheel: `mini_mmlu` / `mini_common_sense` /
  `mini_instruction` (expanded), a new `mini_arithmetic`, and three behavioural
  suites the old gate had no coverage for — `mini_tool_call` (function-calling),
  `mini_format_json` (JSON validity), and `mini_safety` (refusal-rate). Each is
  scored to a per-model absolute score by the pure scorers Kadhi already ships
  (`eval/custom`, `utils/diagnose`); no lm-eval, no network, no download. Every
  suite is large enough that a single-item flip (1/N < 0.05) trips the default
  threshold instead of being rounded away.
- **`kadhi ship` exit codes: usage errors moved 2 → 3.** Exit `2` now means only
  DON'T-SHIP; a typo'd flag or bad `--general-suite` exits `3` (mirroring
  `kadhi plan` / `kadhi env check`), so CI can tell a config error from a caught
  regression. Offline `--evidence` read/parse errors stay `1`. **Breaking** for
  anyone parsing exit `2` as "usage error".

### Fixed

- `kadhi ship` help + docstrings no longer describe `--task-mode pairwise` as
  "reserved for a later release" (it shipped in v0.71.31); the dead
  `SUPPORTED_TASK_MODES` gate is removed.
- `kadhi diagnose`'s package docstring said "Six" probes (there are seven —
  citation) and pointed live loading at an unshipped version; it now re-exports
  all seven `score_*` probe functions so callers need not reach into submodules.

## [0.71.37] - 2026-07-17

**Every `pip install kadhi-cli[extra]` command now works on Windows `cmd.exe`**, and
eval-gate benchmark tasks run instead of always failing.

### Fixed

- **Install hints are now quoted so they work in every shell.** Kadhi printed
  `pip install 'kadhi-cli[ui]'` — bash / zsh / PowerShell syntax. `cmd.exe` has no
  single-quote quoting, so it hands the quotes to pip verbatim and pip refuses:

  ```
  ERROR: Invalid requirement: "'kadhi-cli[train]'": Expected package name at the start of dependency specifier
  ```

  Every hint, README command, and docs example now uses `pip install
  "kadhi-cli[extra]"`, which works in cmd, PowerShell, bash, and zsh alike — the
  same spelling the repo already used for `pip install -e ".[dev]"`. Measured on
  Windows: single quotes fail only on `cmd.exe`; double quotes pass everywhere;
  dropping the quotes passes on Windows but breaks zsh, which globs the bracket.

  Nothing in Kadhi can rescue the command after it is typed — pip and the shell
  own it, and Kadhi is not installed yet when the README command runs — so the
  fix is the spelling we print. A regression test now scans the package and every
  docs code block for the single-quoted form.

  If you followed an older tutorial and hit `Invalid requirement`, swap the `'`
  for `"`; nothing is wrong with the package.

- **Eval-gate `type: benchmark` tasks now actually run.** `eval/gate.py` probed
  for a `forgetting.run_mini_benchmark` helper that never existed, so every
  `type: benchmark` task in a gate suite failed 100% of the time — while
  advising an `[eval]` extras install that could not fix it. The gate now calls
  `ForgettingDetector` directly (the same way `kadhi ship` already did), and an
  unknown benchmark name fails with the list of valid names. Thanks

  #310)

## [0.71.36] - 2026-07-16

**Data Moat II** — a semantic layer over your training data, plus two tools for
what a fine-tune forgets and leaks.

### Added

- **`kadhi data dedup --semantic`** — near-duplicate removal over embedding
  cosine instead of MinHash shingling. Catches *reworded* duplicates that
  MinHash misses (measured: 0.88–0.91 cosine on rewordings MinHash scored as
  distinct) while correctly keeping distinct-but-similar instructions. Zero new
  dependencies: uses `transformers` from the `[train]` extra. **Read the
  known-limitation below before lowering `--threshold`.**
- **`kadhi data topics <data>`** — cluster a dataset and label each cluster with
  c-TF-IDF terms, plus a coverage table (`82% code · 6% math`) and a warning for
  thin topics. Labels are *emergent term clusters*, not a fixed taxonomy.
- **`kadhi data canary insert|check`** — Secret-Sharer memorization probe. Insert
  K high-entropy secrets, then check any model/adapter: each secret's loss is
  ranked against never-inserted controls drawn from the same space. Exit 2 on
  MAJOR so CI can gate. Measured on SmolLM2-135M: a memorized set lands at
  percentile 0.0 (loss 1.7–2.5) against a clean model's 4.1–6.2.
- **`kadhi train --replay old.jsonl --replay-ratio 0.1`** — continual-learning
  rehearsal. Interleaves a seeded sample of an old dataset into training so a
  new task does not erase the old one. `r` is the fraction of the **final**
  mixed set (`n_replay = round(r/(1-r) · n_new)`), rows are interleaved rather
  than appended, and an undersized pool reports the shortfall instead of
  repeating rows. Mixed into `train` only — validation stays pure new-task.

### Fixed

- **The hardware-fit gate refused to train any local checkpoint.** A merged
  model (`kadhi merge -o ./mymodel`) has no size marker in its name, so the size
  guesser returned its 7B default, predicted ~16 GB of VRAM and refused. Local
  checkpoints are now *measured* from their safetensors header (0.135B actual vs
  7.0B guessed) — this had blocked `kadhi merge` → train-from-merged entirely.
  Third instance of this class after the v0.71.32 (Whisper) and v0.71.33
  (`M` suffix) fixes.
- **`pip install 'kadhi-cli[extra]'` hints printed without the extra.** Rich ate
  the bracket, so every "install the missing dependency" message across 17 sites
  told users to run `pip install 'kadhi-cli'` — which succeeds and still leaves
  the feature broken. Affected `[eval]`, `[data]`, `[serve]`, `[ui]`, `[tui]`,
  `[compile]`, `[mcp]`, `[carbon]` and others, including Typer help text.
- Replay rows bypassed the image/audio path-traversal validation that the
  primary dataset receives.

### Known limitations

- **Semantic dedup is not a paraphrase detector.** Measured with
  all-MiniLM-L6-v2, paraphrase cosines (0.49–0.76) **overlap** with
  genuinely-distinct rows (0.54–0.76): "Add two numbers" vs "Multiply two
  numbers" scores 0.759, *higher* than the true paraphrase "reverse a string" /
  "invert the order of characters" at 0.491. **No threshold separates them**, so
  lowering `--threshold` to chase paraphrases deletes real training rows. The
  default (0.8) is deliberately conservative.
- **Replay is validated at proof-of-mechanism scale.** On SmolLM2-135M + LoRA,
  replay retained the old task 7% better than a no-replay control — the correct
  direction — but forgetting without it was only +4%, i.e. mild. The effect size
  at full fine-tuning or 7B+ is unproven on a 4 GB box.
- **Canary exposure is the sampled-control approximation**, not full-space rank
  enumeration. "No exposure" is not proof of no memorization.
- **`data topics` / `dedup --semantic` require `[train]`** (torch) and download
  an embedding model. Plain MinHash `dedup` stays on the light core.
- Replay v1 is `sft`/`pretrain` only and is incompatible with
  `packing`/`multipack`.

## [0.71.35] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Compliance templates — `kadhi init --template hipaa|soc2|eu-ai-act|sr-11-7`.**
  Four regulation-shaped starting configs. Kadhi's compliance controls are CLI
  flags/commands rather than config keys, so each template is a valid training
  config plus header comments naming the exact commands for that regime
  (PHI scrubbing + air-gap for HIPAA, BOM/attest/sign for SOC 2, Annex XI +
  energy tracking for the EU AI Act, repro-receipt + diagnose/ship for SR 11-7).
  Templates default to a license-clean Apache-2.0 base.
- **`kadhi card <registry-id> -o MODELCARD.md` — model-card autogen.** Turns a
  Local Model Registry entry into a publishable, provenance-carrying HF model
  card: base model, training config, eval scorecard, config/data hashes,
  lineage (ancestors) and a table of every registered artifact. Adapter vs
  full-model is inferred from registered artifacts, falling back to the training
  config (LoRA rank, with Spectrum/LISA full-FT correctly treated as dense), so
  the card sets the right `library_name` and never misreports the model type.
- **`kadhi push --card <registry-id>`** — render that registry-driven card and
  upload it as `README.md`, overriding the auto-generated one. A bad ref fails
  fast before any network call; HF hub only.
- **`kadhi ci init` — fine-tuning CI.** Writes `.github/workflows/kadhi-gate.yml`,
  a PR gate chaining `kadhi data validate` → `kadhi expect` →
  `kadhi ship --evidence` (exit 2 blocks the merge). Every interpolated path is
  validated to stay under the repo root and shell-quoted; the branch and Python
  version are regex-gated; the write is atomic, symlink-rejecting, and refuses
  to clobber an existing workflow without `--force`.
- **Compliance quickstart** — a new [docs/compliance.md](docs/compliance.md)
  walkthrough: template → PII scrub → train with receipt/Annex XI/energy →
  registry → BOM + attestation → scan/sign/verify → air-gap → model card → CI gate.

### Fixed
- **GGUF export now actually works on Windows** (validated end-to-end against a
  locally-built llama.cpp: SmolLM2-135M → q4_0 / q4_k_m / q8_0 / f16 → `kadhi deploy
  ollama` → live inference). Four real bugs, each of which independently broke the
  path:
  - **`kadhi export --format gguf` cloned llama.cpp into your current directory.**
    `KADHI_DIR` is the bare name `.kadhi`, but the lookup used it relatively rather
    than anchoring to `~` like the rest of the codebase — so the canonical
    `~/.kadhi/llama.cpp` was never found and a fresh ~200 MB checkout was dropped
    into whatever directory you ran from.
  - **The first GGUF export downgraded your PyTorch and broke CUDA.** The auto-clone
    ran `pip install -r <llama.cpp>/requirements.txt` into your interpreter, and
    llama.cpp pins `torch~=2.2.1` against the CPU wheel index (observed:
    torch 2.5.1+cu → 2.2.2+cpu, transformers 4.57 → 4.46). Kadhi now installs only
    the convert script's extra dependencies, unpinned, and never touches torch.
  - **A correctly-built llama.cpp was not found on Windows.** MSVC (like Xcode) is a
    multi-config generator and emits `build/bin/Release/llama-quantize.exe`; only the
    flat single-config layout was searched.
  - **`kadhi deploy ollama` failed on a relative GGUF path** with "pull model manifest:
    file does not exist" — Ollama resolves `FROM` against the Modelfile's directory,
    and Kadhi writes the Modelfile to a temp dir. The Modelfile now emits an absolute path.
- **Model-card injection hardening (affects the pre-existing `kadhi push` card too).**
  The `## Training` section interpolated `base` / `task` / `scheduler` / `recipe`
  unescaped. Since `KadhiConfig.base` and `scheduler` have no charset validator, a
  crafted-but-valid config could smuggle raw HTML — or a backtick breaking out of
  the surrounding code span — into a card published to the Hub. All values now go
  through the markdown escaper, which additionally neutralises backticks and
  strips C0/ESC control bytes.

## [0.71.34] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- **`kadhi adapters arithmetic` — task-vector algebra over LoRA adapters (add / scale / negate).**
  Apply task arithmetic (arXiv:2212.04089) to LoRA deltas via an expression such as
  `"coder + 0.5*math - toxic"`, mapping names to adapter dirs with repeatable
  `--adapter name=path`. Produces one merged adapter you can serve or merge.
  - Signed, un-normalized element-wise combine over same-rank adapters; the effective
    delta `ΔW = B @ A` scales **linearly** with each coefficient (negation flips the
    delta, `0.5·` halves it) via a √|c| factor split — not the `c²` a naive sum gives.
    Mixed-rank inputs are refused with a clear "harmonize rank" message.
  - Reuses the backdoor-scan gate (refuses a FAIL-scanned input unless `--allow-unscanned`)
    and a same-base-model check (`--allow-cross-base` to override). Hand-written expression
    parser (no `eval`), cwd-contained/symlink-rejecting paths, exit 0 = ok / 1 = refusal.
- **LISA — Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (arXiv:2403.17919).** Full-fine-tuning
  quality at LoRA-like memory: every N steps LISA freezes all decoder layers except a
  small random set (embeddings + head always trainable). Enable with
  `training.lisa_enabled: true` (+ `lisa_num_layers`, `lisa_interval_steps`) on a
  `task: sft`, transformers, text, `quantization: none` run; mutually exclusive with
  LoRA features and the other freeze mechanisms. Live on a 4 GB GPU for small models.

## [0.71.33] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **`kadhi draft` — train and, above all, MEASURE a speculative-decoding draft model.**
  - `kadhi draft measure --target <m> --draft <d> --prompts p.jsonl` reports a draft's
    **acceptance rate** (the fraction of the target's own greedy tokens the draft
    would have proposed correctly) plus **real plain-vs-assisted throughput**. This is
    the honest gate: it tells you whether speculative decoding is worth enabling
    *before* you ship it. Exit 0 / 2 (below `--min-acceptance`, for CI) / 1.
  - `kadhi draft distill --target <tuned> --draft-base <tiny> --data d.jsonl -o draft/`
    distils your target into the tiny base (logit KD via the existing `task: distill`
    trainer) and emits a **dense** draft model, ready to load as an `assistant_model`.
  - `kadhi draft list`, plus a local draft registry (`~/.kadhi/drafts.json`) that
    `kadhi serve --auto-spec` consults **before** the built-in pairing table — so a
    draft you trained yourself is picked up automatically.
  - Draft and target must share a tokenizer; a mismatched pair is refused up front
    (speculative decoding proposes draft token ids into the target's vocabulary, so a
    mismatch silently produces garbage rather than failing).

  **Read the measured results before you use this** — see *Known limitations* below.
  On the validated pair, distillation did **not** improve acceptance, and speculative
  decoding was a net **slowdown**. `kadhi draft measure` is what tells you that.

### Known limitations
- **Distilling a draft did not improve its acceptance rate on the validated pair.**
  Measured on `SmolLM2-360M-Instruct` (target) with a `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct` draft:
  the *stock* draft already scored **69.3%**, and distilling it moved that to 69.7%
  after 2 epochs and back to **69.3%** after 10 epochs — i.e. no gain beyond noise.
  A small same-family draft is already near its capacity ceiling for agreeing with
  the target, and logit KD cannot buy capacity it does not have. Whether distillation
  materially raises acceptance for a genuinely diverged fine-tune, or a larger
  target/draft pair, is **unproven** on a 4 GB box — tracked as a scale issue.
- **Speculative decoding was a net slowdown on that pair** (measured 0.55–0.64×): the
  draft's forward pass costs more than the tokens it saves at this size.
  `kadhi draft measure` reports this truthfully rather than assuming a speedup — which
  is precisely the point of shipping the measurement.
- **Acceptance is teacher-forced greedy agreement**, the metric the Medusa/EAGLE
  papers report. It is exact and deterministic, and it is the right number for
  comparing drafts — but it is not the accepted-token count of a *sampling* run, which
  also depends on the rejection-resample cascade.
- **Same-tokenizer only.** Cross-tokenizer drafts (ULD-aligned + universal assisted
  decoding) are deferred.

### Changed
- **PRM-guided GRPO scores completions in a single batched forward.**
  `PRMScorer.__call__` now right-pads all completions into one `[B, T]` tensor
  (+ attention mask) and runs one `output_hidden_states` pass instead of one
  forward per completion, cutting per-step reward latency on non-tiny models.
  Numerically identical to the per-completion path (parity + mixed-length tests).
  Closes #298
  (#301 by [@Ekaanksh-dev](https://github.com/Ekaanksh-dev)).

### Fixed
- **The hardware-fit gate no longer refuses to train small models.**
  `model_size_from_name` did not understand an `M` (millions) suffix, so
  `SmolLM2-135M` fell through to the 7B default, was predicted to need ~14 GB of
  weights, and was blocked. Every draft-sized model hit this. `1.7B` was also being
  read as `7B` (the `7b` marker matched inside `1.7b`), while `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M`
  correctly stays 7B (1M is the *context*, not the parameter count).
- **`kadhi serve --backend vllm` no longer force-enables `trust_remote_code`.** The
  vLLM path now goes through the same `--trust-remote-code` default-deny gate (and
  warning panel) as the transformers backend, so serving an untrusted repo never
  executes its code silently.
- **Multi-adapter serving (`kadhi serve --adapters name=path`) now actually switches
  adapters.** The named adapters are loaded into the model and selected per request
  (via `POST /v1/adapters/activate/{name}` or the request `adapter` field);
  previously every request silently ran the startup model. The base model is served
  when no adapter is selected.
- **Vision datasets reject out-of-directory image paths.** `llava` / `sharegpt4v`
  rows are containment-checked against `image_dir` (mirroring the audio loader), so a
  crafted `{"image": "/etc/passwd"}` row can no longer read arbitrary local files.
- **`kadhi train --dry-run --gpus N` no longer launches a real multi-GPU run.** The
  accelerate re-exec is skipped under `--dry-run`. The re-exec also now forwards
  `--minillm-on-policy`, `--capture-activations`, and `--capture-prompts` (previously
  dropped on multi-GPU runs).
- **MLX SFT now builds a real optimizer** (`AdamW` from the configured LR) instead of
  passing `optimizer=None`, which left the model untrained.
- **`kadhi data inspect` / `preview` / `search` escape dataset- and Hub-derived text**
  so a stray `[/]` no longer crashes the command and a crafted `[link=…]` tag can't
  render a phishing hyperlink. `kadhi runs` list/show escape config-derived fields too.
- **`kadhi infer --task asr` hardening** — an oversized reference no longer crashes the
  whole batch after transcription (that row's metric is skipped); an all-skipped run
  exits non-zero instead of reporting success; `--asr-task` is validated upfront; and
  dataset-derived filenames are control-stripped before printing. ASR training now
  caps transcript labels to Whisper's decoder limit, warns on >30 s audio, and picks
  fp16 on pre-Ampere GPUs instead of hardcoding bf16.
- **Knowledge-distillation KD term aligns with the CE term.** The token-level
  divergence is now computed over causal-shifted positions, so the distillation signal
  covers exactly the trained tokens (previously off by one).
- **Miscellaneous robustness** — `load_config_from_string` raises `ValueError` (not
  `TypeError`) on a non-mapping YAML document; the Web UI Bearer-token check is
  constant-time; and `kadhi doctor --vscode` / the LR-finder report use the centralised
  atomic, symlink-rejecting writer.

## [0.71.32] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **ASR fine-tuning (`task='asr'`, Whisper)** — fine-tune Whisper on your accent
  or domain, locally. whisper-tiny (39M) / base (74M) train on a 4 GB GPU.
  - New `AsrTrainerWrapper` (HF `Seq2SeqTrainer` + `WhisperProcessor`); data rows
    are `{"audio": <path>, "text": <transcript>}` under the new `data.format='asr'`.
    Audio decodes via the hardened `load_audio_mono` (16 kHz mono, soundfile
    pre-probe + `O_NOFOLLOW` + symlink/size guards); transcripts become decoder
    labels (pad → −100, decoder-start token stripped).
  - Optional LoRA on q/v attention projections via `training.asr_lora: true`
    (default full fine-tune); `training.asr_language` / `training.asr_task`
    (`transcribe`|`translate`) set the decoder prefix and are persisted to an
    `asr_generation.json` sidecar so inference restores them.
  - **`kadhi infer --task asr`** — transcribe an `{"audio": path[, "text": ref]}`
    JSONL; reports per-row and corpus WER/CER when references are present. Loads a
    full model or a PEFT/LoRA adapter dir. Flags: `--asr-language`, `--asr-task`,
    `--audio-dir` (audio paths are cwd/dir-contained; UNC/traversal rejected).
  - New pure-python `utils/asr_metrics.py` — WER / CER / `word_accuracy`
    (= 1 − WER, for a higher-is-better ship metric leg) / `corpus_wer`, with a
    light Whisper-style text normalizer (no new dependency).
  - Recipes: `whisper-tiny-asr`, `whisper-base-asr` (live-trainable),
    `whisper-large-v3-asr` (parse-only, needs a larger GPU), plus
    `smolvlm-256m-sft` (vision). Catalog 138 → 142.

### Fixed
- `model_size_from_name` now knows Whisper checkpoint sizes (tiny…large), so the
  hardware-fit gate no longer mistakes a 39M whisper-tiny for the 7B default and
  blocks ASR training on consumer GPUs.

## [0.71.31] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **Judge-in-the-loop suite** — put an LLM judge in the loop across the workflow:
  - **`task='online_dpo'`** — Online DPO training (wraps TRL `OnlineDPOTrainer`):
    the model generates two completions per prompt on-policy each step and a
    *judge* (a pairwise LLM judge over the existing ollama/openai-compatible
    backend) OR a `reward_model` picks the winner. Config:
    `training.online_dpo_judge: "ollama://model"` (or set `reward_model` —
    exactly one), `online_dpo_loss_type: sigmoid|ipo`, `online_dpo_max_new_tokens`;
    `beta` reuses `dpo_beta`. Transformers + text only. Recipe:
    `online-dpo-smollm2-135m`. Adapts to the installed TRL: on trl 0.19.x the
    judge is a swap-debiased *pairwise* comparison; on trl 1.x (which removed
    pairwise judges) the same `JudgeEvaluator` is used as a *pointwise*
    reward function — a documented per-version behaviour difference.
  - **`kadhi data best-of-n`** — Best-of-N rejection sampling (BOND-lite): sample
    N completions from `--base` locally, a `--judge` scores each pointwise, and
    the winner is written as an SFT chat row (with provenance). `--emit-pairs`
    also writes winner-vs-loser DPO pairs.
  - **`kadhi data evolve`** — Evol-Instruct instruction evolution (WizardLM depth
    / breadth) over an ollama/vllm provider, completing the synthetic-data suite
    (Magpie / Forge / Persona / evolve).
  - **`kadhi ship --task-mode pairwise`** — a true pairwise judge win-rate as the
    ship leg-1 task-win (base = 0.5 coin-flip, tuned = its win-rate; swap-debiased),
    fusing with the catastrophic-forgetting guard into one SHIP / DON'T-SHIP verdict.

### Security
- `kadhi data best-of-n` / `evolve` write outputs via atomic `mkstemp` + `os.replace`
  (re-validated cwd containment), closing the TOCTOU symlink-swap window between the
  containment check and the write. All judge/provider URLs are SSRF-validated; model
  loads probe `trust_remote_code`.

## [0.71.30] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **PRM-guided GRPO** — use a trained Process Reward Model as the *per-step*
  reward inside GRPO (the o1-era process-supervision signal). Set
  `training.prm_reward: <PRM dir|id>` (a model produced by `kadhi train`
  `task=prm`) and `training.prm_aggregate: min|prod|last`; the PRM splits each
  generated completion into reasoning steps, scores every step with its reward
  head, and folds the per-step scores into one scalar reward that GRPO
  optimises. The PRM reward *replaces* `reward_fn` and rides the existing
  reward-shaping + reward-hack-mitigation seam, so the v0.71.26 controller
  observes it. Cross-validators gate `task='grpo'` + `backend='transformers'` +
  `modality='text'`. Default aggregation is `min` (weakest-link); `prod`
  assumes calibrated `[0,1]` step scores.
- **Bundled rollout environments** — three pure-Python toy environments
  (`kadhi_cli.envs.calculator` / `retrieval_qa` / `guess_number`) exposing a
  `rollout(prompts)` entry point so the live `openenv` GRPO rollout path runs
  out-of-the-box: `training.rollout_backend=openenv` +
  `training.rollout_func=kadhi_cli.envs.calculator:rollout`. Three ready-made
  recipes added (`grpo-env-calculator` / `grpo-env-retrieval-qa` /
  `grpo-env-guess-number`); catalog 134 → 137.

### Fixed
- **`kadhi train task=prm` producer conformance** (surfaced by the v0.71.30 live
  smoke): the PRM trainer now casts its reward head to the base-model dtype
  (bf16 CUDA runs previously crashed on the first `compute_loss`), saves the
  tokenizer alongside the model (so a PRM checkpoint is loadable standalone),
  and returns the standard trainer-result shape (previously the CLI crashed with
  a `KeyError: 'initial_loss'` right after saving).

### Notes
- Proof-of-mechanism only: validated on a tiny model (SmolLM2-135M) with a tiny
  synthetic PRM and synthetic reward — not a production reward-model claim
  (scale ask tracked in #286). The bundled environments are deterministic
  single-shot *seeders*, not interactive multi-turn model-in-the-loop episodes
  (the live `openenv` contract passes only prompts). Step split is a newline
  heuristic; PRM completions are scored one forward pass each.

## [0.71.29] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **`kadhi shrink`** — depth-prune a model + optional distill-heal
  ("The Unreasonable Ineffectiveness of the Deeper Layers", arXiv:2403.17887).
  Ranks decoder layers by the angular distance of the residual stream across a
  contiguous block over a calibration set, drops the least-important block
  (first and last layer always protected), optionally *heals* by distilling the
  original model into the pruned student, and emits a single dense smaller model
  plus a one-screen **SHIP / DON'T SHIP** perplexity verdict.
  `kadhi shrink --model <id|path> [--drop-ratio 0.25 | --drop-layers N] --calib
  <calib.jsonl> [--heal <heal.jsonl> --heal-steps N] [--tolerance 0.10]
  [-o <dir>] [--device cpu] [--attach-to-registry <id>] [--plan-only]`.
  Exit codes: 0 = SHIP, 2 = DON'T SHIP, 1 = error. The heal runs as an isolated
  `kadhi train` subprocess (LoRA-student logit distillation) and the adapter is
  fused back so the shipped artifact stays a single dense model. Arch allowlist
  v1: Llama / Qwen / SmolLM. Validated live on SmolLM2-135M (drop 25 %: 30 -> 22
  layers, ppl x2.98 unhealed; drop 4 + heal: ppl x1.35, recovered).

### Security
- `kadhi shrink` contains `--calib` / `--heal` / `--output-dir` (and every
  derived write path: `<out>/model`, `<out>/heal_adapter`, the fuse staging dir)
  under cwd with `os.path.realpath` + `commonpath` + O_NOFOLLOW + symlink
  rejection, re-validating derived paths right before each write (TOCTOU). The
  heal subprocess uses an argv list (no shell) with a timeout; its config is
  schema-validated before spawn; subprocess output is C0/ESC-stripped before it
  reaches the terminal. `--model` defaults `trust_remote_code=False` with a
  probe + warn.

## [0.71.28] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **MCP server (`kadhi mcp serve`)** — drive Kadhi from any Model Context Protocol
  client (Claude Code / Cursor / Cline / Continue) over stdio. No fine-tuning
  CLI ships an MCP server. Exposes 14 read-only tools as JSON — `advise`,
  `data_inspect` / `data_validate` / `data_score` / `data_doctor`,
  `recipes_search` / `recipes_show`, `runs_list` / `runs_show`,
  `registry_list` / `registry_show`, `profile`, `diagnose_evidence`,
  `ship_evidence` — plus two **plan-only** mutating tools (`train_start`,
  `export`) gated behind `--allow-mutating` (they render the exact command that
  would run; they never execute). The official `mcp` SDK is behind a new
  `[mcp]` extra (`pip install 'kadhi-cli[mcp]'`), lazy-imported so the core CLI
  stays light. Security: stdio-only (no network listener); every path argument
  re-enters cwd-containment + symlink rejection; output is control-char
  sanitized; errors are path-free; string / size / int bounds enforced.

### Fixed
- The DPO / IPO / KTO / BCO trainers now apply configured vocabulary expansion
  (`data.add_new_tokens` / `data.new_special_tokens`) via the shared
  `apply_vocab_expansion()` helper during setup, consistent with the SFT path —
  they previously ignored it. Closes #292
  (#293 by [@CODING-DARSH](https://github.com/CODING-DARSH)).
- The ORPO / SimPO / GRPO trainers now also apply configured vocabulary
  expansion via the shared `apply_vocab_expansion()` helper — completing
  consistent vocab-expansion behavior across every SFT/preference/RL trainer.
  Closes #294
  (#295 by [@CODING-DARSH](https://github.com/CODING-DARSH)).

## [0.71.27] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Fine-tune Doctor** — kill the top *silent* fine-tune failures before a
  single training step; no competitor (Unsloth/Axolotl/LlamaFactory) ships
  any of these three:
  - `kadhi data doctor <data> --model <id|path>` — chat-template
    compatibility report over 8 checks: `chat_template` present,
    `template_render`s cleanly, has `{% generation %}` markers,
    `eos_in_labels` (the **#1 "model never stops generating" bug** — every
    assistant turn's trained span must actually contain an EOS/EOT token;
    checks every turn, not just the last), `bos_duplication` (template +
    tokenizer both prepending BOS), `system_role` support (Mistral-style
    templates reject a leading system turn), `unknown_roles`, and
    `truncation_risk` (p95 rendered length vs `max_length`). Same OK / MINOR
    / MAJOR taxonomy as `kadhi diagnose`; exit 0 = OK/MINOR, exit 2 = MAJOR.
    `--train-on-responses-only` / `--train-on-messages-with-train-field`
    select the same masking strategy `kadhi train` would use, so the report
    and `--show-mask` never disagree about what's actually trained.
  - `kadhi data doctor ... --show-mask N` — render N sample rows with
    per-token trained/masked colouring through the REAL collator path
    (answer-only / per-message-train-field / RAFT span-mask) — not a
    reimplementation — so an assistant-mask bug is visible instantly.
  - `kadhi data lint <data>` — preference-data linter for
    dpo/orpo/simpo/ipo/bco/kto: `length_bias` (chosen systematically longer
    than rejected — the **#1 silent DPO degradation**, reported as a
    Cohen's d effect size), `label_imbalance` (KTO desirable:undesirable
    ratio), `near_duplicates` (MinHash/LSH, reuses the `kadhi data dedup`
    kernel), `identical_pairs` (chosen == rejected — zero preference
    signal), and `prompt_leak` (the prompt echoed verbatim inside the
    completion — a common synthetic-data pipeline bug). Optional `--model`
    for exact token-length bias (default: word count).
  - Validated live against the real `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct`
    tokenizer on Windows + RTX 3050 — this smoke pass found and fixed two
    genuine bugs beyond what synthetic fixtures alone caught: an EOS check
    that required the EOS token to be the *literal last* trained token
    (real templates often have a trailing formatting token after the
    closing tag that stays inside the trained span), and two call sites
    that only caught `(ValueError, TypeError)` around a tokenizer's
    `apply_chat_template` when a real Jinja `raise_exception()`
    (Mistral-style no-system-role guard) raises
    `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateError`.

### Fixed
- Harden `commands/diagnose.py`'s `--evidence` loader against a TOCTOU
  symlink swap: opens with `O_NOFOLLOW` and size-checks the open fd via
  `os.fstat` instead of `os.path.getsize` on the path before the open —
  backports the hardened loader shipped for `kadhi ship` in v0.71.25 (closes
  v0.71.25 known-limitation (4)).
- Harden judge-model URL validation against a hostname prefix bypass
  (`http://localhost.attacker.com`) — `GateTask._valid_judge_url` /
  `_parse_judge_url` now use `urllib.parse.urlparse` + hostname checks instead
  of `startswith`. Closes #283
  (#288 by [@CODING-DARSH](https://github.com/CODING-DARSH)).
- `SFTTrainerWrapper` now applies configured vocabulary expansion
  (`data.add_new_tokens` / `data.new_special_tokens`) and resizes the model
  embeddings during initialization — previously these fields were accepted by
  the schema but silently ignored. Closes #289
  (#287 by [@CODING-DARSH](https://github.com/CODING-DARSH)).
- Vision and audio SFT paths now apply that same configured vocabulary
  expansion (`data.add_new_tokens` / `data.new_special_tokens`) via the shared
  `apply_vocab_expansion()` helper, consistent with the text SFT path — they
  previously ignored it. Closes #290
  (#291 by [@CODING-DARSH](https://github.com/CODING-DARSH)).

### Security
- `kadhi data doctor` strips C0 control characters (keeping tab/newline/CR)
  from dataset-derived content before it reaches the terminal — Rich's
  `markup.escape()` only neutralises `[...]` tag syntax, not raw escape
  sequences, so an untrusted training row (e.g. an unknown `role` field, or
  `--show-mask`'s decoded token text on a byte-level BPE tokenizer) could
  otherwise carry a literal ESC byte through to the terminal (title-bar /
  OSC-8 link spoofing, or obscuring a MAJOR verdict via cursor tricks).
  `--output` JSON is unaffected (`json.dumps` already escapes control
  characters).

## [0.71.26] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Closed-loop reward-hacking auto-mitigation.** The trainer now *detects*
  reward hacking mid-run and *self-corrects* — instead of only halting. Set
  `training.reward_hack_mitigation` (or `kadhi train --reward-hack-mitigation`)
  to one of four modes on a GRPO/PPO run (requires `reward_hack_detector`):
  - `log_only` — instrument only: append a per-step `mitigation_log.jsonl`
    (drop_pct, verdict, reward mean/std, completion-length trend, repetition)
    and *never* touch training.
  - `kl_control` — a reversible **bang-bang + hysteresis** controller: when the
    hacking signal trips, raise the KL coefficient β (geometric, clamped to
    `[floor, ceil]`, never crossing 0); relax it when the signal recovers.
    Dwell + release-patience prevent flapping; a multi-signal vote combines the
    detector drop with a length-trend and repetition signal.
  - `pid_lagrangian` — a **PID-Lagrangian** controller (Stooke et al.) that
    holds the hacking signal at a target, plus an **escalation ladder**:
    raise β → roll back to the last-good RL checkpoint → early-stop.
  - Anti-gaming hardening: per-signal EMA/median smoothing,
    conservative-on-disagreement voting, a reward-distribution-drift guard, and
    optional bounded **reward shaping** on the gamed proxy (length / repetition
    / sentinel). A plain-English give-up explanation is logged on early-stop.
  - **Proof-of-mechanism only** (see Known Limitations): validated on
    SmolLM2-135M + a synthetic length-hacking task on a single RTX 3050 — all
    four stages pass live, including a real mid-run rollback. PPO ships **BETA**
    (mechanism unit-tested; the on-GPU proof is GRPO-only).
- Ready-made `qwen2.5-coder-7b-sft` recipe for `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct`
  (catalog 133 → 134)
  (#285 by [@Deadpool2000](https://github.com/Deadpool2000)).

### Security
- `RLCheckpointCallback.restore_checkpoint` / `save_checkpoint` refuse a
  **symlinked** `optimizer.pt` — `torch.load(weights_only=False)` on an
  attacker-placed symlink in a shared checkpoint dir was an RCE vector.
- Bool-before-int/float guards on every new `reward_hack_*` numeric field;
  `reward_hack_signals` bounded (`max_length=4`); the mitigation log writer is
  cwd-contained with symlink-reject-on-rotate and secret redaction.

## [0.71.25] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **`kadhi ship` — the SHIP / DON'T-SHIP verdict.** After fine-tuning, answer one
  question: did the model get better, or did I break it? `kadhi ship` fuses two
  checks into a single binary decision — **leg 1**: the task metric *strictly*
  improved (base → tuned); AND **leg 2**: no general benchmark regressed past a
  forgetting threshold (default 0.05 absolute points). It SHIPs only when both
  hold — otherwise DON'T SHIP, *even if the task metric looks great*. The output
  is a one-screen verdict + the reason, with CI-gateable exit codes
  (0 = SHIP, 2 = DON'T SHIP, 1 = runtime error).
  - Leg-1 modes: `--task-mode metric` (eval accuracy) or `judge_score`
    (LLM-as-a-judge); pairwise win-rate is planned for a later release.
  - Leg-2 suite: built-in mini benchmarks by default (offline, CPU), or
    `--general-suite <names>` to route lm-eval benchmarks; `--baseline
    registry://… | file.json` supplies recorded base scores.
  - `--evidence ev.json` decides offline from pre-computed scores (no model
    load); `--output verdict.json` persists the machine-readable verdict.
- Friendlier error messages: the CUDA-OOM hint now also suggests
  `gradient_checkpointing` and `4bit` quantization, plus new mappings for
  Hugging Face gated repos (`huggingface-cli login` / `HF_TOKEN`) and
  `trust_remote_code` errors. Closes #272
  (#282 by [@Akshaya-reddy18](https://github.com/Akshaya-reddy18)).

### Security
- `kadhi ship` input hardening: `--evidence` is opened with `O_NOFOLLOW` + an
  fstat size cap (16 MiB) under cwd containment; `--task-eval` is cwd-contained
  and symlink-rejected; `--judge-model` is validated by scheme/host via
  `urlparse` (blocks the `http://localhost.attacker.com` prefix bypass);
  lm-eval model ids reject `,`/`=` injection; `--general-suite` is bounded
  (≤ 50 names, ≤ 256 chars each).

## [0.71.24] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **2026 model-family recipe expansion (catalog 116 → 133).** 17 new ready-made
  SFT recipes for the open-weight models released Feb–Jun 2026, each with its
  Hugging Face repo-ID verified to resolve:
  - **Qwen 3.5 (Apache-2.0):** `qwen3.5-0.8b-sft`, `qwen3.5-2b-sft`,
    `qwen3.5-4b-sft`, `qwen3.5-9b-sft`, `qwen3.5-27b-sft`, and the
    `qwen3.5-35b-a3b-sft` / `qwen3.5-122b-a10b-sft` / `qwen3.5-397b-a17b-sft`
    MoE sizes.
  - **Qwen 3.6 (Apache-2.0):** `qwen3.6-27b-sft`, `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-sft`.
  - **DeepSeek-V4 (MIT):** `deepseek-v4-flash-sft`, `deepseek-v4-pro-sft`.
  - **GLM (MIT):** `glm-5.1-sft`.
  - **Kimi (Modified MIT):** `kimi-k2.5-sft`, `kimi-k2.6-sft`.
  - **MiniMax (MiniMax Community License — commercial use needs a separate
    agreement):** `minimax-m3-sft`.
  - **Mistral Large 3 (Apache-2.0, 675B/41B-active multimodal MoE):**
    `mistral-large-3-sft`.
- Unit-test coverage for the `warmup.py` auto-warmup-steps helper
  (#274 by [@shatakshi-1404](https://github.com/shatakshi-1404)).

### Fixed
- **Stale recipe repo-ID:** `glm-5-sft` now points at `zai-org/GLM-5` (the org
  migrated from `THUDM`).

## [0.71.23] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Native Spectrum targeted training (closes #266).** A new `kadhi spectrum
  scan` reads a model's `.safetensors` shards **one tensor at a time** (no
  model load — peak RAM is the largest single weight matrix), computes a
  singular-value SNR per weight matrix with a Marchenko-Pastur noise threshold
  (arXiv:2406.06623), ranks layers within each module-type group and prints
  the top `--top-percent` as a ready-to-paste `training.unfrozen_parameters`
  YAML block. This lets you scan even a very large model's layer SNR on a CPU
  box and then full-fine-tune only the high-signal layers.
  - `kadhi spectrum scan --model <id|path> --top-percent 50 [--modules mlp,attn|all] [--output patch.yaml]`
    — SNR table + the YAML patch; results cache at `~/.kadhi/spectrum/<slug>.json`
    (override via `KADHI_SPECTRUM_CACHE_DIR`).
  - New schema field `training.unfrozen_parameters: list[str]` — regex patterns
    of parameter names to keep trainable; the SFT trainer freezes every
    parameter then unfreezes the matched set (full fine-tuning, LoRA off).
    Mutually exclusive with LoRA features / `freeze_layers` / `freeze_ratio` /
    `train_router_only` / `expand_layers`; requires `task=sft`,
    `backend=transformers`, `modality=text`, and `quantization=none`.
  - The SNR kernel is pure-numpy and transpose-invariant (singular values are
    identical for `W` and `W.T`); GPT-2 `Conv1D` naming
    (`c_attn`/`c_fc`/`c_proj`) is recognised alongside Llama-style names.
  - The existing `spectrum` trainer-plugin wrapper is untouched (back-compat).
    LISA (per-step layer sampling) is tracked separately in #267.

### Security
- `kadhi spectrum scan` validates `unfrozen_parameters` patterns at parse time:
  rejects nested-unbounded-quantifier regexes (ReDoS), null bytes, empties, and
  caps count (50k) and length (512). Hub downloads route through the
  SSRF-hardened, namespace-pinned `hubs.snapshot_download`; symlinked shards and
  matrices above a 2^31-element SVD cap are skipped; `--output` stays under cwd.

## [0.71.22] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Perf & measure polish** — a 4-issue patch tightening four live paths from
  the recent BETA lifts. Pure code, validated on Windows + RTX 3050.
  - **MiniLLM on-policy KV-cache (closes #263).** The on-policy distillation
    rollout (`kadhi train` with `training.minillm_on_policy: true`) now threads
    `past_key_values` so each step forwards only the new token instead of
    re-feeding the whole prefix — resolving the O(L²) per-step cost from
    v0.71.18. A LoRA student (the common distill case) activates the cache
    too: the new `_supports_kv_cache` probe unwraps the PEFT model via
    `get_base_model()` before deciding. The teacher is always cached; the
    student cache respects the retained autograd graph and degrades gracefully
    if a model returns no cache mid-loop.
  - **`kadhi serve --mole` KV-cache (closes #262).** Each of the N task adapters
    in a served MoLE now keeps its own KV cache in lockstep, created fresh per
    `generate()` call (never stored on the instance, so there is no
    cross-request leak). Top-k zero-weight adapters are still skipped, and the
    output is byte-identical to the no-cache path on a real MoLE.
  - **Deploy-autopilot live measure factories (closes #143).** `kadhi deploy
    autopilot --measure` ships a first-party transformers loader factory (lazy
    import, per-candidate quant config via the Quant Menu loader; `before` =
    base, `after` = quantised) replacing the inject-only test hooks. The
    baseline is now scored **once** and the whole candidate list is
    **pre-validated up front**, so a typo in `--measure-candidates` raises
    before any model load instead of burning N live loads or doubling peak
    VRAM.
  - **Live-codec TTS via SNAC, partial (#265-partial).** The live-codec
    encode path (`data.format='audio'`) is validated for **Orpheus**:
    `load_audio_mono` now probes `soundfile.info` (duration + byte cap)
    *before* `soundfile.read` (no multi-GB decode into RAM) and reads through
    an `O_NOFOLLOW` file descriptor; a real SNAC-backed encode of a 24 kHz wav
    produced 42 Orpheus codec tokens.

### Fixed
- MiniLLM on-policy KV-cache was silently disabled for LoRA students (the
  PEFT wrapper hid the base model's `past_key_values` support) — now probed
  via `get_base_model()`.
- Deploy-measure no longer re-scores the baseline once per candidate or burns
  live model loads on a bad candidate (per-candidate validation moved up front).
- `load_audio_mono` capped audio duration only *after* decoding into RAM —
  the cap is now checked from `soundfile.info` before reading.

### Known limitations
- KV-cache correctness is validated (cache == no-cache equality on real tiny
  artifacts) but large-model throughput gains were not measured on the 4 GB
  dev box.
- **#265 stays open** — the live-codec `data.format='audio'` SNAC encode path
  is validated for Orpheus only; the other four TTS families keep their
  per-family codec dependency gate.
- The deploy-measure first-party factory's real quantized (bitsandbytes 4-bit)
  load is CUDA + bitsandbytes-gated; on Windows / no-bnb the injected test
  seams are the validated path.
- The MoLE serve KV-cache assumes single-sequence (`B == 1`) decode.

## [0.71.21] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Precision & rollout lift (BETA, hw-gated)** — lifts five deferred
  `NotImplementedError` stubs to live code.
  - **FP8 attention + NVFP4 (closes #141).** `training.fp8_attention: true`
    now converts the model's attention projections (q/k/v/o + fused qkv
    variants) to FP8 training modules via torchao's
    `convert_to_float8_training` with an attention-only `module_filter_fn`
    (Hopper SM ≥ 9.0 gate); `training.nvfp4: true` quantises via torchao's
    `NVFP4Config` (Blackwell SM ≥ 10.0 gate). Both are wired into the v0.28
    speed/memory pipeline and degrade to a visible yellow advisory when the
    gate fires — a conversion failing partway raises an honest "model may be
    PARTIALLY converted" error rather than silently training on a
    half-converted model.
  - **vLLM sleep mode (closes #124).** `training.vllm_sleep_mode: true` is
    live: `create_vllm_engine(sleep_mode=True)` sets
    `AsyncEngineArgs.enable_sleep_mode` (vLLM ≥ 0.7 gate with a friendly
    upgrade message), the new `vllm_sleep_cycle(engine, level=1|2)` context
    manager wraps the optimisation step (wake in `finally`), and the GRPO
    trainer threads the flag into TRL's `GRPOConfig` when the installed TRL
    exposes the hook (advisory otherwise).
  - **Multi-turn agent rollout launchers (closes #125).** `kadhi train` with
    `task: grpo` + `training.rollout_backend: openenv` +
    `training.rollout_func: my_module:fn` now runs a LIVE rollout: the
    resolver imports the operator's callable (same trusted-code policy as
    `data.prompt_strategy`), feeds it the dataset prompts as seeds, and the
    returned `{prompt, answer?}` rows replace the prompt dataset. Rows are
    normalised (extra keys stripped, message-list prompts deep-copied,
    non-string answers rejected loudly). `art` / `ruler` / `nemo_gym` raise a
    friendly ImportError when the backend package is missing and an honest
    BETA gate when present (injectable `_EXTERNAL_ROLLOUT_RUNNERS` seam).
    Validated by a real GRPO + openenv rollout train on SmolLM2-135M.
  - **Apple-adapter conversion (closes #228).** `kadhi apple-adapter` is live
    for `hf-to-mlx` / `mlx-to-hf`: PEFT LoRA safetensors ↔ mlx-lm adapters
    with both matrices transposed (`lora_A [r,in]` ↔ `lora_a [in,r]`),
    bf16 sources upcast via the torch loader, `adapters.safetensors` +
    `num_layers` emitted for mlx-lm's `load_adapters`, rank/alpha/dropout
    carried through, legacy `adapters.npz` still read, optional v0.60
    Merkle-root signing. The `*-to-apple` directions stay upstream-gated
    (no published FoundationModels adapter spec). Validated by a real bf16
    PEFT adapter round-tripping with numeric equality.
  - **Llama-4 expert delinearization (closes #97).** `kadhi
    delinearize-llama4` now runs a live torch runtime: fused 2-D expert
    tensors `[E*dim_in, dim_out]` reshape to 3-D `[E, dim_in, dim_out]`
    (expert count from `config.json` or `--num-experts`), other tensors pass
    through, JSON sidecars are copied, writes are atomic. `--plan-only`
    keeps the old render-and-exit flow.

### Fixed
- `safetensors.numpy.save` silently mangles non-contiguous (transposed)
  arrays — the apple-adapter writer now makes every array C-contiguous
  first (caught by the new round-trip assertions).

### Known limitations
- fp8_attention / nvfp4 / vllm_sleep_mode are BETA hardware-gated — the
  converters and gates ship validated via capability probes and fake-module
  dispatch tests, but end-to-end runs need a Hopper/Blackwell GPU + torchao
  (or vLLM ≥ 0.7), none of which exist on the maintainer's RTX 3050 /
  Windows box. The `art` / `ruler` / `nemo_gym` rollout adapters are
  honestly BETA-gated until validated against the upstream packages.

## [0.71.20] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Modality II trainers — TTS / BitNet / MoE expert quant (BETA, hw-gated)**
  — lifts three v0.52.0 schema-only `NotImplementedError` stubs to real code.
  - **TTS fine-tuning** (closes #131). `kadhi train` with `task='tts'` +
    `modality='audio_out'` now routes to a live `TTSTrainerWrapper`. TTS
    families (Orpheus / Sesame-CSM / Llasa / Spark / Oute) are decoder
    language models, so a TTS fine-tune is next-token cross-entropy over
    interleaved `[text][audio-codec-token]` chat sequences — the wrapper
    reuses the SFT path and adds per-family emotion-control templating
    (Orpheus / Oute) and registration of operator-supplied codec special
    tokens (`data.new_special_tokens`) with an embedding resize. The
    **pre-encoded chat workflow** (codec tokens produced offline, then trained
    with `data.format=chat`) is the live, validated path; the **live-codec
    workflow** (`data.format='audio'`, encode raw audio at train time) needs
    the family's heavyweight codec dependency (SNAC / BiCodec / XCodec2 / …)
    and is hardware/dependency-gated with a friendly per-family `RuntimeError`.
    Verified end-to-end on SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.
  - **BitNet 1.58-bit** (closes #134). `build_bitnet_trainer` returns a live
    `BitNetTrainerWrapper` that gates on the upstream `onebitllms` package
    (absent → friendly `RuntimeError` naming it). `kadhi export --format
    bitnet | tq1_0` now runs a real llama.cpp TQ1_0 ternary export (reuses the
    v0.53.1 gguf convert→quantize pipeline) instead of the deferred panel; it
    requires a built llama.cpp toolchain (friendly `FileNotFoundError` when
    absent).
  - **MoE expert quant + router-only training** (closes #136).
    `apply_moe_expert_quant` detects fused-MoE expert `nn.Linear` blocks and
    replaces them with bitsandbytes `Linear4bit` (`nf4`) / `Linear8bitLt`
    (`int8_rowwise`), leaving attention + the router in full precision; it
    runs **before** `get_peft_model` (QLoRA-on-experts) so PEFT attaches to the
    quantized base. `train_router_only` freezes every expert and keeps the
    gating router trainable, applied after LoRA. CUDA-gated (friendly
    `RuntimeError` when bitsandbytes/CUDA absent). Validated live on an
    RTX 3050: 8 expert Linears → 8 `Linear4bit` with dequant error 0.0155 vs
    source (weights genuinely carried), router-only freeze, and device-aware
    placement.

### Known limitations
- The TTS live-codec workflow, BitNet 1.58 training (`onebitllms`), and BitNet
  GGUF export (llama.cpp) are hardware/dependency-gated — the friendly gates
  ship and the plumbing is validated, but the end-to-end runs against real TTS
  models + audio codecs / a BitNet base + onebitllms / a built llama.cpp
  toolchain stay open infra-blocked items on the maintainer's RTX 3050 / Windows
  box.

## [0.71.19] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Quant Menu for vision / audio modality** (closes #81). The Quant Menu
  (`gptq` / `awq` / `hqq:Nbit` / `aqlm` / `eetq` / `mxfp4` / `fp8`) was rejected
  by the config modality gate for `modality in {vision, audio}` — those paths
  carried inline `BitsAndBytesConfig` blocks that handled only `4bit` / `8bit`.
  v0.71.19 drops the gate (the mlx-backend gate is retained) and threads the
  unified `build_quantization_config_for_loader` through
  `_setup_vision_transformers` / `_setup_audio_transformers`, so multi-modal SFT
  can train a LoRA on top of any pre-quantized base. The `4bit` / `8bit` config
  shapes are byte-for-byte the same as the old inline blocks; `mxfp4` still
  routes through `prepare_model_for_kbit_training`. Verified: the unified loader
  returns the right config object for every format on both modalities, and
  `_setup_vision_transformers` threads a `GPTQConfig` into
  `AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained`.

### Fixed
- **Multipack DataLoader sharding under FSDP / DeepSpeed ZeRO / DDP** (closes
  #80). The multipack `get_train_dataloader` override built a raw `DataLoader`
  and returned it directly, so under distribution every rank trained on the
  **same** packed bins (no data sharding). It now routes the loader through
  `accelerator.prepare(...)` when `num_processes > 1` — exactly what HF Trainer's
  own `get_train_dataloader` does — so accelerate's `BatchSamplerShard`
  round-robins whole bins across ranks (preserving the FFD packing) and
  equalises per-rank batch counts. The single-process path is unchanged
  (byte-for-byte the validated v0.40.4 raw-DataLoader behaviour). Verified live:
  a single-GPU multipack SFT on SmolLM2-135M trains end-to-end (RTX 3050). Full
  multi-GPU validation remains a QA item (no multi-GPU box); the distributed
  routing is mocked-tested.

## [0.71.18] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **MiniLLM true on-policy rollout** (closes #257). `training.minillm_on_policy:
  true` (with `minillm_enabled: true`) replaces the offline distribution blend
  with the real on-policy procedure of Gu et al. 2024 §3.1: each step samples a
  fresh autoregressive rollout from the per-token mixture
  `ratio·teacher + (1-ratio)·student`, then accumulates the length-normalised
  reverse-KL `KL(student || teacher)` on the full distributions (differentiable
  w.r.t. the student only; sampled tokens are detached). New
  `training.minillm_rollout_length` knob ([1, 512]; auto-derives
  `min(max_length, 32)` when unset — the loop re-forwards the full prefix each
  step, so keep it small). Verified live: on-policy distill on tiny-gpt2
  (student + frozen teacher), finite loss, end-to-end train.
- **Cross-tokenizer ULD with token-sequence alignment** (closes #258). New
  `training.uld_strategy: wasserstein_aligned` handles **fully-disjoint**
  tokenizers (not just a vocab-size mismatch): per batch element the student and
  teacher token sequences are aligned over their decoded character spans
  (offset-overlap when both decode to the same text, difflib Ratcliff-Obershelp
  char matching otherwise), the teacher logits are mean-pooled onto the student
  positions, and the existing sorted-Wasserstein-1 surrogate is applied.
  Verified live: aligned distill with a GPT-2 BPE student + a Llama SentencePiece
  teacher, finite loss, end-to-end train.
- **`kadhi agent eval --sandbox`** (closes #110). Each heuristic-passing tool-call
  prediction is now *executed* against a generated mock of the endpoint in the
  v0.25.0 RLVR `code_exec` sandbox and classified into ok / tool_error / timeout
  / arg_error. The endpoint path, its required path params, and the predicted
  arguments are base64-embedded as **data** (no code interpolation). Strong
  isolation (RLIMIT / namespaces / sandbox-exec) is POSIX-only; on Windows the
  subprocess + 5 s timeout + 10 KB output cap + network guard still apply (a
  friendly reduced-isolation advisory is printed). Verified live on Windows:
  4-prediction scorecard (ok=1 / tool_error=1 / arg_error=2 / timeout=0).
- **`kadhi train --cloud modal`** (closes #16). Render a self-contained Modal.com
  app from `kadhi.yaml` for serverless GPU training when you have no local GPU.
  The config YAML is base64-embedded as data (no interpolation, no secrets); the
  `--gpu` type (t4 / l4 / a10g / a100 / a100-80gb / l40s / h100) is validated
  against a closed allowlist. Default is **plan-only**: write the stub + print the
  `modal run` command. `--cloud-submit` attempts a live submit gated on a Modal
  token (`modal setup` / `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` + `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`). New
  `[modal]` extra (`pip install 'kadhi-cli[modal]'`; only needed for live submit —
  plan-only render needs no dependency). Verified live: real stub rendered, exit
  0.

## [0.71.17] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Serve-time MoLE** (closes #259). A `task='moe_lora_routing'` run now writes a
  self-describing `mole_manifest.json` next to `mole_gate.pt`, and
  `kadhi serve --mole <dir>` loads the base + N frozen task LoRAs + the trained
  gate and blends them **per token** at decode time (custom blend loop —
  non-streaming + streaming). `--mole` requires `--backend transformers` and is
  mutually exclusive with `--bank` / `--steer` / `--adapters` /
  `--speculative-decoding`. The base model comes from `--base` (or the manifest
  when unset). Verified live on SmolLM2-135M (2 task adapters, real generation +
  SSE streaming).
- **Per-request multi-tenant vector banks** (closes #260). `kadhi serve --bank`
  now resolves the active VeRA/VB-LoRA user per request via a
  `contextvars.ContextVar`, so concurrent requests on a threaded server never
  race on shared instance state. The streaming path re-selects the user inside
  the generator's own context. Verified live: two `X-User-Id` headers produce
  distinct steered outputs, an absent / unknown id self-clears to the clean
  baseline (no cross-request leak), and a repeated user is deterministic.
- **Epoch-aware RAFT document shuffle** (closes #253). `data.raft_epoch_shuffle:
  true` re-permutes the golden + distractor documents **each training epoch**
  (per-epoch salt) so the model can't latch onto one fixed citation slot.
  `epoch=0` reproduces the legacy single-permutation order exactly. Verified live
  on a 2-epoch SmolLM2-135M RAFT run.
- **`kadhi diagnose --citation-style` / `--shuffle-seed`** (closes #254). The live
  citation failure-mode probe now accepts the citation style (bracket / inline /
  footnote) and the RAFT shuffle seed so the golden `[doc-N]` ids line up with
  what the model saw at train time. Verified live (rows=6, mean_recall=1.000).

### Fixed
- MoLE `train()` now returns the `initial_loss` / `final_loss` / `total_steps` /
  `duration_secs` / `duration` keys the generic train handler reads, so
  `kadhi train task=moe_lora_routing` completes cleanly (previously raised
  `KeyError: 'initial_loss'` after writing the gate). Surfaced by the #259 smoke.

## [0.71.16] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- **Covariance-preconditioned ROME via `--cov-corpus`** (closes #250). `kadhi edit
  set --method rome --cov-corpus <jsonl|txt>` now estimates the key covariance
  `C = E[k kᵀ] + λI` over a stats corpus and uses the preconditioned update
  `u = C⁻¹ k*` instead of the covariance-free `C = I` path — the genuine ROME
  closed form, which spreads the rank-1 update mass to reduce collateral
  interference with other facts. Falls back to `C = I` when no corpus is given.
  The exact post-condition `down(k*) += delta` is preserved either way. The
  corpus loader is cwd-contained, symlink-rejected (O_NOFOLLOW + raw-path
  lstat), and size/line-capped; `--cov-corpus` is rejected (fail-loud) for any
  method other than `rome`. Verified on real `gpt2` (prob 0.005 → 0.9997) and
  SmolLM2-135M.
- **GPT-2 (`transformer.h` / `mlp.c_proj`) support in the edit kernels** (closes
  #251). ROME / MEMIT / AlphaEdit now edit GPT-2-family models, not just
  Llama-family. The `Conv1D` weight layout (`[in, out]`, transposed relative to
  `nn.Linear`'s `[out, in]`) gets a transpose-aware rank-1 update, AlphaEdit
  null-space projection, and MEMIT band dim-check. PEFT-wrapped GPT-2 / Llama
  models are unwrapped via `get_base_model`. Verified end-to-end on real `gpt2`.
- **Mixtral joins the LongLoRA architecture allowlist** (closes #147). A bare
  `mistral` token does not appear in `mixtral` (m-i-x vs m-i-s), so the existing
  `is_mistral_model` detector excluded the MoE variant. A dedicated
  `is_mixtral_model` helper + `MixtralAttention` entry in the S² forward-override
  regex + `_SEPARATE_QKV_FAMILIES` now cover Mixtral-8x7B / 8x22B (the attention
  is the standard separate-QKV shell; the MoE lives in the MLP).

### Fixed
- **Atomic `EditGovernor` edit-count increment** (closes #252). Two concurrent
  `kadhi edit set` runs on the same base model could lose an increment: each read
  the persisted count, added locally, and the last writer clobbered the first.
  `save_state` now re-reads the persisted count INSIDE the cross-process lock and
  merges this run's delta (`edit_count − persisted_baseline`), mirroring the
  v0.60.0 `namespace_pin` pattern. Verified: two governors recording 3 + 2 edits
  from the same baseline persist a merged 5 (not a clobbered 2 or a naive +1).

### Notes
- Test count: 13511 → 13595 (+84 net; +81 in `tests/test_v07116.py`).

## [0.71.15] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- **Iterative-DPO config render bug** (closes #261). `kadhi iterative-dpo`'s
  default per-round trainer rendered `output: {dir: ...}` (a mapping), which
  `KadhiConfig.output` (a plain string) rejected — so the spawned `kadhi train`
  subprocess failed at config validation. Now renders `output: <str>`, mirroring
  the v0.71.13 #229 `local-rl` fix. A regression test captures the rendered YAML
  and validates it via `load_config_from_string`; verified end-to-end with a real
  `kadhi train` round on SmolLM2-135M.

### Changed
- **CMA-ES merge loads the base model once** (closes #246). `kadhi adapters merge
  --strategy cmaes` previously reloaded the (multi-GB) base model into a fresh
  PEFT wrapper on every candidate in the population. The default scorer now loads
  the base once and reuses it across the whole `population × generations` loop —
  each candidate only loads its small merged LoRA, applies it, generates, and
  unloads it. Verified on SmolLM2-135M: the base loads exactly once across N
  candidates.
- **`kadhi loop` budget gate now estimates real cost** (closes #245). The
  pre-wired loop's per-iteration cost estimate was a hard `0.0` placeholder, so
  the dollar budget gate never tripped. It now wires v0.34 `run_cost.
  estimate_run_cost_usd` off the most-recent completed run's GPU + duration (the
  best forward signal for a repeating loop). Falls back to `0.0` on the first
  iteration / a CPU / unpriced GPU; never crashes the daemon.
- **`--diagnose-gate` is multi-node aware** (closes #170). The post-training
  diagnose gate (and the `--annex-xi` / `--repro-receipt` / capture hooks) fired
  on `LOCAL_RANK==0`, so a shared-filesystem multi-node run ran them once per
  *node*. They now gate on the global chief (`RANK==0` when `RANK` is set, else
  `LOCAL_RANK==0`) — once per *cluster*.

### Added
- **`kadhi train --track-energy --energy-out <path>`** (closes #244) persists the
  measured energy/CO2 reading as JSON so `kadhi bom emit --energy <path>` (the
  v0.71.3 #256 consumer) can attach it to an ML-BOM. Atomic + cwd-contained +
  symlink-rejected. Completes the train → BOM energy hand-off.

## [0.71.14] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Live FSDP shard consolidation** (closes #96). `kadhi merge-sharded-fsdp-weights`
  lifts the v0.44.0 plan-only stub: it now streams each `pytorch_model_fsdp_*.bin`
  shard via `torch.load(weights_only=True)` (no arbitrary pickle exec), unions the
  per-rank parameter fragments into one state-dict, and writes a single
  `.safetensors` atomically. Memory-friendly (one shard loaded at a time). New
  `--plan-only` flag prints the plan without writing. Single-process — no
  multi-GPU needed to MERGE. (Per-rank disjoint-parameter / FULL_STATE_DICT
  shards; DCP sharded-tensor reconstruction is out of scope — use
  `accelerate merge-weights` for those.)
- **Live `kv_cache_type` wiring on the transformers serve backend** (closes #140).
  `kadhi serve --kv-cache-type q8_0 | bf16 | f16 | fp8` lifts the v0.53.1
  `apply_kv_cache_type` `NotImplementedError` stub: `bf16`/`f16` load the model in
  that dtype (the KV cache inherits it); `q8_0` routes an 8-bit HQQ quantized KV
  cache through `model.generate` (needs `pip install hqq`); `fp8` raises a friendly
  runtime error (vLLM + Hopper-only — the transformers backend has no fp8 KV
  path). vLLM / SGLang KV-cache-dtype routing stays in the infra-blocked tail.
- **ONNX export QA verified** (closes #71) — `kadhi export --format onnx` exercised
  end-to-end on a tiny model: export exits 0, `model.onnx` loads in ONNX Runtime
  with `input_ids` present, and a forward pass produces a real output. Recorded in
  `tests/qa/v07114_qa.md`.

### Notes
- GGUF export (#70), AWQ/GPTQ export (#72), the CUDA + llama.cpp QA doc (#144),
  HF Hub push/Spaces deploy (#74), and the Community-QA tracking meta-issue (#79)
  remain open with `infra-blocked` labels — they need a built llama.cpp toolchain,
  `autoawq`/`auto-gptq` Windows wheels, or HF credentials the QA box lacks. See
  `tests/qa/v07114_qa.md`.

## [0.71.13] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Prompt-compile family — live wiring** (closes #225, #226, #227, #229). Four
  `kadhi` commands that shipped as deferred-stub `NotImplementedError` in v0.68.0
  are now real, validated end-to-end (real DPO train on SmolLM2-135M + real
  Ollama teacher distillation on RTX 3050).
- **`kadhi local-rl train` runs a real nightly DPO/KTO/ORPO train** (#229).
  `--once` harvests the latest thumbs-up/down DPO pairs from the local-RL SQLite
  and trains them via a `kadhi train` subprocess (argv list, no shell); a `state`
  table tracks `last_train_at` so a re-run with no new feedback skips, and a run
  with fewer than `--min-pairs` (default 10) skips. Without `--once` it renders a
  systemd `.service`/`.timer` + launchd `.plist` scheduler scaffold into
  `--scheduler-dir` for the user to install. New flags: `--once`, `--min-pairs`,
  `--output/-o`, `--scheduler-dir`, `--hour`, `--minute`.
- **`kadhi distill-prompt` prepares a real distillation dataset** (#226). For
  each prompt in the traces JSONL the teacher is called once via the v0.20
  provider helpers (Ollama / Anthropic / vLLM); `sft`/`kl` emit
  `{messages:[user, assistant=teacher]}` and `preference` emits
  `{prompt, chosen=teacher, rejected=student}`. New flags: `--provider`,
  `--base-url`, `--temperature`, `--max-rows`.
- **`kadhi compile` runs DSPy / GEPA / TextGrad prompt-program optimisation** (#225)
  and **`kadhi compile-tools` runs the TextGrad / GEPA tool-schema optimiser** (#227),
  both lazy-importing the optimiser libraries behind the new `[compile]` extra
  (`pip install 'kadhi-cli[compile]'`) with a friendly `ImportError` naming the
  extra when absent. `--plan-only` still renders the plan and exits 0.

### Security
- **systemd / launchd injection defence** (#229). `local-rl` and the scheduler
  renderers reject `\n` / `\r` in the model id and shell-quote every `ExecStart`
  argument, so a crafted model id cannot inject extra unit directives.

### Fixed
- **`local-rl` train config rendered `output` as a mapping** (#229). The nightly
  `kadhi train` YAML now emits `output: <dir>` (a plain string the schema accepts)
  instead of `output: {dir: <dir>}`; a regression test validates the rendered
  config against `KadhiConfig`.

## [0.71.12] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Architecture + distillation + adapter-training — live wiring** (closes #145,
  #146, #148, #158, #84, #221, #222). Seven surfaces that shipped schema-only in
  earlier releases are now real, validated end-to-end on tiny models
  (SmolLM2-135M / a locally-built tiny Llama).
- **Sequence-level knowledge distillation is live** (#145). `task: distill` now
  accepts `distill_mode: token|sequence`; sequence mode trains the student on the
  teacher's generated continuations (cross-tokenizer-friendly hard-label KD)
  instead of per-token logit matching. `sequence` mode is mutually exclusive with
  the v0.70 cross-tokenizer ULD logit path.
- **Classifier LoRA is live** (#146). `task: classifier|reranker|cross_encoder`
  now attaches a LoRA adapter to the sequence-classification head when `lora` is
  configured, so a frozen encoder + small adapter can be trained instead of the
  full model.
- **LLaMA Pro block expansion is per-architecture** (#148). `expand_layers`
  now interleaves zero-initialised identity blocks for Llama / Qwen / Mistral
  decoder stacks (was Llama-shaped only), with `freeze_trainable_layers`
  freezing the original blocks so only the new ones train.
- **LongLoRA S² shifted-sparse attention is live** (#158). `use_longlora: true`
  now installs the shifted-sparse-attention forward override on the Q/K
  projections (Llama / Mistral / Qwen / Phi), restoring the patched forwards on
  context exit.
- **Mixture-of-Depths is live** (#84). `use_mod: true` attaches a per-layer
  top-k token router (`mod_capacity_factor`) so only a subset of tokens receive
  each block's residual update. Architecture allowlist: Llama / Qwen / Mistral;
  unsupported bases warn and skip.
- **VeRA / VB-LoRA multi-tenant serving is live** (#221). `kadhi serve --bank
  <bank.json> [--bank-strength S]` reconstructs the shared projection + per-user
  scaling vectors and installs a decode-time forward hook; the active user is
  selected per request via the `X-User-Id` header (an unknown/absent id is a
  zero-delta no-op, so there is no cross-request leak). Serves N personas at
  ~KB-per-user instead of a full LoRA each.
- **MoLE per-token adapter routing is live** (#222). `task: moe_lora_routing`
  with `mole_task_adapters: [...]` trains a per-token gating network that blends
  N frozen task LoRAs (`mole_top_k` / `mole_temperature`); only the router
  trains. The gate is saved as `mole_gate.pt` alongside the run.

### Changed
- `apply_bank_to_serve` (#221) and `build_gating_kernel` (#222) now return live
  objects (a `LoadedVectorBank` and a `torch.nn.Module` router) instead of the
  v0.67.0 deferred-stub `NotImplementedError`.

## [0.71.11] - 2026-06-04

### Added
- **GRPO / RL callbacks — live wiring** (closes #235, #236, #237, #238, #239,
  #240, #159, #160). The reward-hacking, cross-tokenizer distillation, MiniLLM,
  mid-epoch RL checkpoint, iterative-DPO and echo-trap surfaces that shipped
  schema-only in v0.70.0 are now real, validated end-to-end on SmolLM2-135M.
- **Reward-hacking detector is live** (#235). `--reward-hack-detector
  info_rm|rm_ensemble` now installs a GRPO `TrainerCallback` that reads the
  per-step rewards (via a shared, thread-safe reward-fn capture buffer),
  computes an InfoRM cluster-separation drop (`info_rm`) or RM-ensemble
  divergence (`rm_ensemble`), classifies OK/WARN/HACK, logs the verdict to
  `state.log_history`, and halts training on HACK when `--reward-hack-halt` is
  set. `rm_ensemble` requires ≥2 reward functions.
- **Cross-tokenizer ULD distillation is live** (#236). `task: distill` with
  `--uld-strategy wasserstein|topk_align` now computes a real Wasserstein-1
  (sorted-CDF) or top-k-aligned distillation loss inside the distill trainer,
  handling student/teacher vocab-size mismatch by clamping teacher ids to the
  teacher vocab.
- **MiniLLM reverse-KL distillation is live** (#237). `--minillm-enabled` adds
  a teacher-mixed, length-normalised reverse-KL term plus an optional
  pretrain-anchor SFT term (`--minillm-pretrain-anchor-path` /
  `--minillm-pretrain-anchor-weight`) that keeps the student near coherent
  language. The anchor corpus reader is cwd-contained + symlink-rejecting with
  a per-line byte cap.
- **Mid-epoch RL checkpoint is live** (#238). `--rl-checkpoint-save-every-steps
  N` writes a real adapter + optimizer state + JSON manifest every N steps
  during PPO/GRPO and prunes to `--rl-checkpoint-keep-last`, so a long RL run
  survives a crash without losing the optimizer momentum.
- **`kadhi iterative-dpo` orchestrator is live** (#239). Runs the full
  sample → reward-score → build-pairs → DPO-train loop across rounds: each
  round samples completions from the previous round's adapter, the next round
  trains a fresh LoRA from the base on that round's harvested pairs.
  `--plan-only` still renders the plan without running.
- **Echo-trap detector is live** (#240). `--echo-trap-enabled` installs a GRPO
  callback that scores per-trajectory n-gram repetition, classifies
  OK/WARN/TRAP against `--echo-trap-threshold`, logs the verdict, and halts on
  TRAP when `--echo-trap-halt` is set (catches RAGEN-style degenerate
  repetition in multi-turn agent RL).
- **GRPO variant fallback now warns once** (#159). When a `--grpo-variant`
  custom `compute_loss` falls back to the base trainer (because the installed
  TRL renamed the loss inputs), the trainer logs a one-shot WARNING instead of
  silently degrading to the default objective.

### Changed
- **GRPO reference-model EMA no longer materialises full state dicts** (#160).
  `--ref-model-ema-alpha` now updates the reference model in place by iterating
  `named_parameters()` (`ref = (1-α)·ref + α·policy`), eliminating the three
  model-sized allocations per step the v0.53.11 path made. A total
  name/shape-mismatch (0 shared parameters) logs a one-shot WARNING so a
  misconfigured EMA can't silently no-op.

## [0.71.10] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **RAG family — live wiring** (closes #199, #200, #201, #202). The four
  retrieval / steering surfaces that shipped schema-only in v0.62.0 are now
  real, validated on SmolLM2-135M.
- **RAFT span-mask training is live** (#199). `data.format: raft` rows
  (`{query, golden_doc, distractor_docs, answer}`) now train answer-only: the
  prompt span is masked to `-100` and each document is labelled `[doc-N]` so
  the model learns to cite the supporting document. Documents are shuffled
  reproducibly (`data.raft_shuffle_seed`). Rows whose prompt fills
  `max_length` (answer fully truncated) are dropped with a warning rather than
  silently shrinking the effective dataset.
- **`kadhi ra-dit` — one-shot two-stage orchestrator** (#200). Trains the
  retriever (stage 1, embedding/contrastive) then the generator (stage 2,
  RAFT-SFT) in a single command, recording the trained retriever as the
  generator's paired retriever. A `kadhi train` of a generator-stage config
  with no retriever model set now auto-links the most-recent RA-DIT retriever
  run from the Registry. `--plan-only` validates both configs without
  training; `--retriever-model` overrides the auto-link.
- **`kadhi steer train` / `apply` + `kadhi serve --steer` are live** (#201).
  Fit a CAA (contrastive activation addition), ITI (inference-time
  intervention) or RepE (representation-engineering PCA) control vector from
  `{positive, negative}` contrastive pairs, persist it as a safetensors +
  config artifact, and apply it at decode time via a forward hook
  (`kadhi serve --steer <name> --steer-strength <s>`).
- **`kadhi eval citation` + citation-span loss boost are live** (#202). Score
  citation precision / recall / F1 over `{predicted, expected_ids}` or RAFT
  rows (`--shuffle-seed` aligns the golden `[doc-N]` id with what the model
  saw at train time). When `citation_faithful: true`, bracketed `[doc-id]`
  spans in the answer get a boosted per-token loss weight. A new `citation`
  failure mode is available in `kadhi diagnose`.

## [0.71.9] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Knowledge edit + unlearn — live wiring** (closes #193, #194, #196, #197,
  #203). The v0.61.0 / v0.62.0 schema-only stubs are now live, validated on
  SmolLM2-135M.
- **`kadhi edit set` (ROME / MEMIT / AlphaEdit) is live** (#194). New
  `kadhi_cli/utils/edit_kernels.py` ships covariance-free rank-1 weight-edit
  kernels: ROME (single-layer `W += δ·kᵀ/‖k‖²`), MEMIT (residual distributed
  across a layer band), AlphaEdit (ROME update projected orthogonal to the
  down-proj's top singular direction). `apply_edit` loads the model, optimises
  the target residual, applies the rank-1 update, and optionally saves with
  cwd-containment + symlink rejection. `--output`, `--device`, `--governor/
  --no-governor` flags added. On a tiny model a ROME edit moved
  `P("Lyon" | "The capital of France is")` from 0.0016 → 0.96.
- **`kadhi edit diff` live before/after generation** (#194). Pass
  `--before-model` + `--after-model` (+ `--probes`) to generate completions
  through both models and surface the probes whose output changed.
- **EditGovernor SQLite persistence + cross-process locking** (#196). New
  `EditGovernorStore` (mirrors `namespace_pin.NamespacePinStore` —
  $HOME/$CWD/$TMPDIR containment, TOCTOU symlink rejection, WAL +
  busy_timeout, `fcntl`/`msvcrt` sidecar lock, POSIX 0600). `save_governor` /
  `load_governor` / `default_governor_db_path` (env override
  `KADHI_EDIT_GOVERNOR_DB`) persist per-base-model edit-count + verdict across
  separate `kadhi edit set` runs.
- **`apply_edit` consults the EditGovernor automatically** (#197). When a
  governor is supplied, `check_can_edit()` runs BEFORE the model load (refusing
  on norm blowup / edit cap) and `record_edit()` runs AFTER with the measured
  Frobenius delta.
- **Live GRACE codebook** (#203). `GraceCodebook` (epsilon-ball nearest-key
  lookup), `apply_grace_edit` (captures a residual key + optimises a value +
  appends to a codebook sidecar), `save_codebook` / `load_codebook` (atomic,
  cwd-contained, symlink-rejected), `install_grace_hook` (decode-time residual
  substitution). New `edited_model` / `grace_codebook` Registry artifact kinds.
- **`kadhi train --task unlearn` is live (NPO / SimNPO / RMU)** (#193). New
  `kadhi_cli/utils/unlearn_kernels.py` (NPO `(2/β)·mean(-logσ(-β(πlp-reflp)))`,
  length-normalised SimNPO, RMU representation steering) + a self-contained
  `UnlearnTrainerWrapper` loop loading a LoRA policy, a frozen reference
  (NPO/RMU), and forget/retain JSONL datasets. NPO/SimNPO forget loss
  decreased on the tiny-model smoke. Warns when run without a retain set.

### Security
- `_save_edited_model` / `UnlearnTrainerWrapper` output dirs + `save_codebook`
  / `load_codebook` + `_load_unlearn_rows` enforce cwd-containment, raw-path
  symlink rejection (TOCTOU), null-byte rejection, and file-size / per-line
  caps. `apply_grace_edit` honours the governor for direct callers.

## [0.71.8] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Probes & SAE — real weights + live downloads** (closes #215, #216, #217,
  #218, #219). A new shared `kadhi_cli/utils/probe_kernel.py` provides the
  linear-probe math (contrast-pair derivation, apply, flag-rate, verdict bands,
  operator-supplied weight loading, deterministic synthetic fallback); every
  heavy import (`numpy` / `torch` / `safetensors`) is lazy.
- **`kadhi probe sleeper --weights <w.npz|.npy|.safetensors>`** (#215) — load a
  real calibrated probe direction instead of the synthetic fallback. Weights are
  cwd-contained, symlink-rejected, `O_NOFOLLOW`-opened, `allow_pickle=False`,
  and size-capped. `compute_contrast_probe(positive, negative)` derives a probe
  from contrast-pair activations.
- **`kadhi probe sae-diff <repo> --auto-download`** (#216) — fetch an
  allowlisted SAE from the HF Hub into `~/.kadhi/sae-cache/` (validated against
  `HF_HUB_ALLOWLIST` BEFORE any network call) via a new SSRF-hardened
  `kadhi_cli.utils.hubs.snapshot_download` (repo-id shape + home/cwd/tmp cache
  containment + namespace-pin TOFU gate).
- **`kadhi probe truth` / `kadhi probe harm`** (#217) — TruthfulQA-style honesty
  and HarmBench-style misuse activation probes (6 bundled bases each, 5% / 20%
  verdict bands, `--weights` to skip the allowlist with a real probe). The
  probe pack now ships truth + harm entries per base.
- **`kadhi probe interference --measure <eval_suite> --base-model <m> --adapter
  name=path ...`** (#218) — auto-measure the N×N interference matrix by actually
  loading the base + each LoRA adapter (PEFT multi-adapter), measuring loss for
  each adapter alone (diagonal) and each co-loaded pair
  (`add_weighted_adapter(combination_type="cat")`, off-diagonal). Exit 2 on a
  MAJOR worst-pair.
- **`kadhi train --capture-activations <layer> --capture-prompts <jsonl>`** (#219)
  — a post-training hook writes an SAE-diff-ready per-token activation snapshot
  to `<output>/activations/activations.json`. `resolve_layer_module` resolves
  the same `model.layers.N` path whether or not a LoRA adapter is loaded
  (PEFT-wrapper fallback).

### Security
- Probe / SAE / capture file I/O is cwd-contained + `O_NOFOLLOW` (TOCTOU close)
  + size-capped; SAE weight loads use `allow_pickle=False`. SAE auto-download
  validates the allowlist before any network call and rejects a glob result
  that resolves outside the snapshot dir (symlink-escape guard).

### Notes
- #215 is partial: the operator-supplied / contrast-pair / synthetic paths ship
  now, but the 6 large-base Anthropic-calibrated probe vectors remain
  upstream-gated (no public calibrated artifact exists). Documented as a known
  limitation.

## [0.71.7] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Eval live runners** — six probe surfaces that previously emitted heuristic
  / neutral stubs now load a real model and run live (closes #161, #162, #208,
  #211, #212, #165). New shared `kadhi_cli/utils/live_eval.py` provides the
  model-loading primitives (generator / multi-generator closures, masked
  cross-entropy eval-loss, a short-LoRA probe, and held-out logit agreement);
  every heavy import (`torch` / `transformers` / `peft` / `lm_eval`) is lazy.
- **`kadhi advise --probe-model <id>`** — runs a LIVE ROI probe: zero/few-shot
  token-F1 baselines, a short LoRA probe (relative held-out-loss improvement +
  real wall-clock), and base-model proximity (held-out logit agreement) folded
  into the dataset profile. Without `--probe-model`, `--probe` stays the offline
  heuristic.
- **`kadhi tunability --live`** — replaces the offline heuristic with a real
  per-candidate LoRA probe (loads each `repo_id`, trains `--probe-steps` on a
  held-out-excluded slice, reports the held-out-loss drop).
- **`kadhi eval capability --live --model <id>`** — invokes lm-eval-harness per
  resolved task (or a `--tasks` override) with `--limit` / `--device`, isolating
  per-task failures and surfacing a no-metric result as an explicit error.
- **`kadhi eval behavior --base-model <id> [--adapter <path>]`** — generates
  pre/post responses on the bundled behaviour battery and scores the live diff.
- **`kadhi diagnose --base-model <id> [--adapter <path>] [--dataset <jsonl>]
  [--tokenizer <id>]`** — runs all six failure-mode probes (forgetting / refusal
  / format / mode_collapse / memorization / contamination) live via
  `kadhi_cli.utils.diagnose.live.run_live_diagnose`; falls back to neutral OK or
  `--evidence` JSON when no model is supplied.

### Security
- The two new JSONL dataset readers (`diagnose.live._load_dataset_rows`,
  `tunability._load_jsonl_rows`) open with `O_NOFOLLOW` after the cwd-containment
  check, closing the check→open TOCTOU window (matches the v0.65 / v0.67 reader
  policy).

## [0.71.6] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **`kadhi build` live runner** — the dbt-for-SFT DAG (`kadhi build <manifest>`) now
  *materialises* datasets instead of only dry-running the plan. Five built-in
  transforms ship live (`identity`, `drop_empty`, `lowercase`, `strip`,
  `dedup_exact`); `table` rebuilds from scratch, `view` re-derives on every run,
  and `incremental` re-transforms only the rows whose content hash changed
  (tracked in a SQLite state store, keyed by row hash **and** the model's
  transform+config fingerprint so a transform change re-runs everything). Custom
  transforms are passed per-run via the Python API's `transforms=` map. Outputs
  are written atomically; the `--output-dir` is symlink-checked before any
  directory is created.
- **`kadhi data gen-magpie` live generator** — the Magpie synthetic generator
  (Xu et al. 2024) now actually generates. It feeds an aligned model its
  chat-template prefix (chatml / llama3 / gemma / mistral families auto-detected)
  and harvests the self-generated user instruction + assistant response via raw
  completion. Live providers: `ollama` (`/api/generate` raw) and `vllm`
  (`/v1/completions`) — both SSRF-hardened (loopback-only HTTP); `anthropic` is
  rejected (no raw-completion endpoint). Optional `--quality-filter` drops
  low-quality rows via the v0.47 toxicity/educational scorers; exact-duplicate
  instructions are de-duplicated.
- **`kadhi eval irt-subset --model {1pl,2pl,3pl}`** — the IRT eval-cost optimiser
  gained 2PL (per-item discrimination) and 3PL (+guessing floor) joint
  coordinate-ascent MLE fits alongside the existing 1PL Rasch. `1pl` keeps the
  closed-form path for back-compat; `2pl`/`3pl` route through the new `fit_irt`.
- **Tokenizer-aware memorization probe** — `score_memorization(..., tokenizer=...)`
  and `split_prefix(..., tokenizer=...)` (used by `kadhi diagnose`) now split the
  prefix/suffix on real token-id boundaries and measure echo-overlap over
  sub-word tokens when a tokenizer (HF id / path / duck-typed object) is supplied,
  catching BPE-level memorization that whitespace tokenisation misses. Default
  (no tokenizer) keeps the whitespace behaviour.

### Fixed
- **`kadhi data augment --provider ollama|vllm` no longer crashes** — the command
  imported a non-existent `OllamaProvider` symbol and raised `ImportError` on
  every non-OpenAI provider. It now routes through the shared, SSRF-hardened
  provider factory; `--model` / `--base-url` are honoured, the output path is
  containment- and symlink-checked, and the write is atomic.

### Security
- **Ollama / vLLM provider URLs reject `0.0.0.0`** — `validate_ollama_url` /
  `validate_vllm_url` dropped the bind-any wildcard from their loopback allow-set
  (now `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1` only), matching the newer
  `validate_hub_endpoint` / `validate_webhook_url` SSRF validators. Reachable now
  that Magpie threads a user-supplied `--base-url` through these providers.

## [0.71.5] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **`kadhi eval against` now reads eval metrics** — `ExperimentTracker.get_metric_series`
  falls back to the `eval_results` table when the metric is not a per-step
  training column (`loss` / `lr` / `grad_norm` / `speed` / `gpu_mem`). So
  `kadhi eval against <base> --candidate <run> --metric task_accuracy` returns a
  real score series (benchmark scores live in `eval_results`, not `metrics`)
  instead of "Empty series". Per-step columns still read from `metrics` — no
  regression for existing callers.
- **`kadhi advise` learns from past project outcomes** — `kadhi advise` now reads
  this project's accepted-verdict history (`~/.kadhi/advise_history.jsonl`) and
  biases the rubric: 3+ successful SFT precedents flip a marginal RAG call to
  SFT; 3+ negative GRPO outcomes suppress GRPO in favour of SFT-on-traces; an
  encouraged choice gets a small confidence nudge. Scoped per-project (one
  project's record never biases another). No history → identical to before.
- **Slack/Discord webhooks on four more commands** — `--slack-url` / `--discord-url`
  (SSRF-hardened, loopback-only HTTP, RFC1918 rejected, never crashes the
  command) now ship on `kadhi ingest`, `kadhi prune-prompt`, `kadhi ab` (fires only
  on a `reject_h0` / `accept_h0` decision, not `continue`), and
  `kadhi data active-sample` — not just `kadhi drift-alarm`. The validator + sender
  moved to a shared `kadhi_cli/utils/webhooks.py`.
- **Tokenizer-aware `kadhi prune-prompt`** — `--tokenizer <model_or_path>` detects
  and strips the shared system-prompt prefix on **token** boundaries instead of
  characters, so a multi-byte UTF-8 prefix can never be split mid-code-point.
  Default (no `--tokenizer`) keeps the whitespace-character behaviour.
- **Curriculum bucketing by loss percentile** — `DynamicCurriculumCallback` now
  buckets samples by the percentile rank of the live loss (or perplexity)
  signal within a rolling window when `data.curriculum_metric` is `loss` /
  `perplexity`, so a consistently-hard sample is routed to the same difficulty
  bucket across recomputes. `length` and warm-up still use round-robin.
- **`--hub` on `kadhi data push` and `kadhi data forge`** — `kadhi data push
  --hub modelscope|modelers` uploads a dataset via the matching SDK
  (`repo_type=dataset`, commit message sanitised); `kadhi data forge --hub
  <non-hf> --teacher owner/name` pre-fetches the teacher model from that hub
  (and warns when the teacher is not a repo id so `--hub` is never silently
  ignored). HF stays the default.

### Notes
- Live SaaS *pull* adapters for `kadhi ingest` (Langfuse / LangSmith / Helicone /
  OpenPipe / OpenAI SDKs, issue #204) remain deferred: they need credentialed
  vendor accounts with populated trace data to validate honestly. Tracked as an
  open, `infra-blocked` (external-account) item. `kadhi ingest` continues to parse
  the JSONL export you pull from your dashboard.

## [0.71.4] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Live canary verdict for `kadhi adapters merge`** — `--canary <suite.json>`
  scores the merged adapter against the first input and classifies
  **OK / MINOR / MAJOR** using the Quant-Lobotomy taxonomy (drop <2% OK, <5%
  MINOR, else MAJOR). `--strict-verdict` exits 2 on MAJOR. Pre-scored
  `{"baseline_scores","candidate_scores"}` suites run with no model load; a
  `{"tasks":[...]}` suite uses an injectable scorer. Replaces the v0.57 `UNKNOWN`
  stub.
- **Live evolutionary merge** — `kadhi adapters merge --strategy cmaes --eval
  <suite> --budget <t>` now runs the full CMA-ES loop: each candidate is merged,
  materialised, scored against the eval suite, and the best-weighted merge is
  written to `--output`. Replaces the v0.67 plan-only stub.
- **Publish an adapter PR to GitHub** — `kadhi adapters pr <title> --base-sha
  <hex> --adapter <path> --push owner/repo#N` posts the rendered PR Markdown as a
  GitHub PR comment via `gh api` (argv-list, body over JSON stdin; no shell).
  Token resolves from `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN`.
- **Pre-wired `kadhi loop` production stages** — `kadhi loop init --pre-wired` (or
  `kadhi loop watch --pre-wired`) swaps the v0.58 no-op stage stubs for real
  harvest (traces → preference pairs) → DPO train → eval-gate → canary-deploy
  callables. `kadhi loop status` now shows the `pre_wired` flag.
- **Loop iterations as Kadhi Cans + Registry lineage** — `kadhi loop watch
  --pack-cans` packs each successful iteration as a v0.26 Kadhi Can and appends a
  Registry entry (tag `loop-iter`), chaining a real lineage DAG across
  iterations visible through `kadhi history`. `kadhi loop replay <id> --extract
  <dir>` unpacks a recorded iteration.
- **Branch pointers into the Registry** — `kadhi adapters branch <name>
  --attach-to-registry <id>` links a branch snapshot to a Registry entry (shown
  as a `branches` node in `kadhi history`); `kadhi adapters branch <name>
  --from-registry <id>` derives a fresh snapshot's config + base from an entry.

### Security
- The backdoor-scan gate (v0.71.2 #192) and license-conflict gate (v0.60 Part E)
  now run for **all** merge strategies, including `--strategy cmaes` (previously
  bypassed because cmaes returned before the gates).
- `kadhi loop` canary deploy restricts `KADHI_LOOP_SERVE_ENDPOINT` to loopback /
  RFC1918-private hosts (a serve endpoint is the operator's own box/LAN), beyond
  the general webhook SSRF policy which permits any HTTPS host.
- `kadhi adapters pr --push` builds the `gh` child environment from an allowlist
  so unrelated secrets (`HF_TOKEN` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / …) never reach the
  subprocess.
- The canary-suite JSON read uses `O_NOFOLLOW` + `os.fstat` (size cap enforced on
  the same fd) to close the symlink/size-cap TOCTOU window.

## [0.71.3] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **Energy & CO2 measurement for training** — `kadhi train --track-energy` wraps
  the training window in a codecarbon **offline** tracker (no IP-geolocation
  network call) and reports kWh / CO2 / grid intensity, feeding those numbers
  into `--annex-xi`. New `EnergyTracker` context manager; graceful no-op when
  codecarbon is absent (`pip install kadhi-cli[carbon]`). `--energy-country`
  picks the ISO-3166 alpha-3 grid for the CO2 estimate (default `USA`).
- **PDF Annex XI/XII documents** — `kadhi train --annex-xi report.pdf` now renders
  a reportlab PDF (a `.md` path still renders markdown). `pip install
  kadhi-cli[pdf]`.
- **Auto-populated training-corpus domains in Annex XI/XII** — the top crawled
  domains (with shares) are now extracted from the training JSONL and listed in
  the EU AI Act docs, replacing the previous empty placeholder.
- **Kadhi Can manifest v3 with embedded attestations** — `kadhi can pack --attest
  <statement.json>` (repeatable) embeds in-toto Statements into a v3 can
  manifest; v1/v2 cans still load. Each statement is shape- and size-validated.
- **Local audit log auto-instrumentation** — every `kadhi` command now appends one
  HIPAA/SOC2-shaped record to `~/.kadhi/audit.jsonl` (secrets redacted, args
  capped). Opt out per-invocation with `--no-audit-log` or globally with
  `KADHI_NO_AUDIT_LOG=1`. Tail/rotate with `kadhi audit-log`.
- **Reproducibility receipt in airgap bundles** — `kadhi airgap-bundle
  --repro-receipt <receipt.json>` embeds an SR 11-7 receipt as
  `repro-receipt.json`; auto-detected from `<model>/repro-receipt.json` when not
  supplied.

### Security
- `kadhi can pack --attest` now rejects oversize attestation files by their raw
  size *before* parsing them into memory (defence against memory-exhaustion).
- The new file-loading paths (attestation JSON, airgap receipt, training-corpus
  scan, PDF write) are all cwd-contained + TOCTOU symlink-rejected and
  size-capped; the audit auto-log redacts `hf_`/`sk-`/`Bearer` tokens and never
  crashes the CLI on a broken log.

## [0.71.2] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- **ed25519 signing for `kadhi adapters sign` / `kadhi attest`** — real detached
  signatures (over the adapter Merkle root / the in-toto statement) via a new
  `[sign]` extra (`pip install kadhi-cli[sign]`, pulling `cryptography`).
  `kadhi adapters sign --backend ed25519 --key <priv.pem>` (or `--generate-key
  <out.pem>`, or `KADHI_SIGNING_KEY`); `kadhi adapters verify [--public-key
  <trusted.pem>]` does a cryptographic verify and, with a trusted key, genuine
  authentication. `kadhi attest emit --sign ed25519 --key <priv.pem>` writes a
  `<output>.sig` sidecar; new `kadhi attest verify <statement> --signature <sig>`
  verifies it (canonical-JSON, so it's platform/newline-independent). Sigstore
  keyless signing stays infra-blocked (needs an OIDC provider + Fulcio/Rekor
  network — can't be honestly validated offline).
- **Anti-AI-Jacking namespace pin on Hub downloads** — HF model fetches now
  consult a trust-on-first-use pin store: a repo whose author changes (or whose
  `created_at` jumps backward) is refused unless the namespace shift is explicitly
  allowed. Fails open when repo metadata is unavailable.
- **License auto-detection at `kadhi adapters merge`** — when `--license` isn't
  given, the license is read from each adapter's `adapter_config.json` /
  `config.json` / model-card frontmatter (HF `llama3.1`-style ids mapped to
  canonical) and the conflict gate runs automatically.
- **Backdoor-scan gate at `kadhi adapters merge`** — refuses to merge any input
  whose `kadhi adapters scan` returns FAIL (or can't be scanned) unless
  `--allow-unscanned` is passed; WARN is advisory.

### Changed
- License-conflict overrides (`--license-override <reason>`) are now recorded to
  the audit log for legal review.
- The namespace-pin store now uses SQLite WAL + busy-timeout and a cross-process
  file lock around its get+insert, so concurrent writers don't lose the trust
  anchor.

### Security
- ed25519 verification fails closed (any tamper / wrong key / missing key ⇒
  invalid). Signing keys + trusted public keys are symlink-rejected and
  size-capped via a shared reader (no cwd-containment — keys live outside the
  project). `--generate-key` refuses to overwrite any existing path.

## [0.71.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- `kadhi env fix` — render a reproducible install plan from `kadhi-env.lock`.
  Emits copy/paste `uv pip install` commands (`--format uv-pip`, default) or a
  `requirements.txt` body (`--format requirements`); `--output` optionally writes
  a `requirements.txt` under cwd. Print-only by design — never shells out to a
  package manager.
- `kadhi lock write --env-lock <path>` — auto-derive `--env-hash` from a
  `kadhi-env.lock` so operators who ran `kadhi env lock` don't copy the hash by
  hand. `--env-hash` still wins when passed explicitly.
- `kadhi serve --record-thumbs <db>` — capture thumbs-up/down feedback into a
  local-RL SQLite at startup, plus a new `POST /v1/thumbs` endpoint (transformers
  backend). Returns 404 when the flag isn't set.
- Judge-calibration persistence: `JudgeCalibrationReport.to_dict`,
  `write_judge_calibration`, and `load_judge_calibration`, backed by a new
  `judge_calibration` registry artifact kind. Loading re-validates the report so
  a corrupt on-disk field is rejected.
- Bundled MUSE and WMDP unlearning eval fixtures so
  `kadhi eval unlearning --benchmark muse|wmdp` runs out of the box. WMDP
  forget-set probes ship **redacted** (placeholder prompts + `REFUSED` responses)
  — Kadhi never ships verbatim hazardous content.

### Changed
- `kadhi completions` now introspects a cached base model's actual LoRA target
  modules (config-only `AutoConfig` load, `local_files_only=True`, never networks
  or raises) and falls back to the canonical default shape when the base isn't
  cached locally.
- `build_dag` exposes a `validate_build_source` helper (cwd-containment +
  symlink rejection) for build-manifest source paths.

## [0.71.0] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **Breaking — install split.** The heavy training stack (`torch`,
  `transformers`, `peft`, `trl`, `datasets`, `bitsandbytes`, `accelerate`) moved
  out of the core install into a new `[train]` extra. `pip install kadhi-cli` is
  now a light CLI + data-tools install with **no PyTorch**; run
  `pip install 'kadhi-cli[train]'` (or `[all]`) to fine-tune. Existing users who
  train must reinstall with `[train]`. Version pins are unchanged.
- Trimmed `README.md` to a ~238-line front door; the full feature reference now
  lives under `docs/` (one topic page per area, indexed from the README).
- Raised the pytest coverage gate from 50% to 77% (`--cov-fail-under=77`).
- Migrated to a `src/` layout (`src/kadhi_cli/`) for cleaner packaging and to
  stop tests accidentally importing the in-tree package.

### Added
- `[train]` and `[all]` optional-dependency extras (`[all]` pulls
  `train`, `serve`, `ui`, `data`). `[dev]` self-references `[train]` so CI and
  contributors still get the full stack from `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
- Friendly error mapping: a missing heavy dependency (`torch`, `transformers`,
  `peft`, `trl`, `datasets`, `bitsandbytes`, `accelerate`) now surfaces
  "Training needs the [train] extra. Run: pip install 'kadhi-cli[train]'".
- `py.typed` marker (PEP 561) so downstream type checkers pick up Kadhi's inline
  type hints.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with ruff (lint + format) and standard file-hygiene
  hooks.
- Lenient `mypy` configuration and a non-blocking `type-check` CI job.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Removed
- The historical, per-version security-fix log that had grown inside
  `SECURITY.md` (~220 KB). `SECURITY.md` is now a concise security policy; the
  detailed hardening notes remain in git history and the GitHub Releases notes.
