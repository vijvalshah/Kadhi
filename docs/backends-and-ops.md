## Autopilot (Zero-Config)

Skip the YAML entirely. Give Autopilot a base model, a dataset, and a goal — it analyzes your data, model, and hardware, then picks the task, quantization, LoRA rank, learning rate, epochs, and performance flags for you.

```bash
# Zero-config: pick everything automatically
kadhi autopilot --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
               --data ./data/train.jsonl \
               --goal chat

# Other goals: chat | code | reasoning | instruct | vision
kadhi autopilot --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B --data ./data/math.jsonl --goal reasoning

# Constrain to a GPU budget (1GB to 1TB)
kadhi autopilot --model <id> --data d.jsonl --goal chat --gpu-budget 24GB

# Preview the generated config without running
kadhi autopilot --model <id> --data d.jsonl --goal chat --dry-run
```

Autopilot writes a ready-to-run `kadhi.yaml`. Edit it by hand if needed, then `kadhi train`.


## Apple Silicon (MLX Backend)

Fine-tune on M1-M4 Macs via Apple's [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) framework — no CUDA, no emulation.

```bash
# Install MLX support
pip install "kadhi-cli[mlx]"
```

For SFT with local JSONL, JSON, or CSV data, `[mlx]` is sufficient on its own.
It can also be installed with `[train]` when the same environment needs the
PyTorch/TRL Transformers backend: both extras now share the supported
`transformers>=5.16.1,<6` range. A Hugging Face `datasets` source or
streaming dataset still needs `datasets` because that data source owns the
dependency; the local file path below does not.

`detect_device()` and `get_gpu_info()` recognise Apple Silicon when
`backend: mlx` is set, preserving `training.quantization: 4bit` for
`mlx-community` pre-quantized checkpoints instead of silently downgrading to
`none` (#423). The
CUDA-shaped analytical VRAM preflight is skipped on the MLX path because Apple
unified memory is managed by Metal, not a fixed CUDA VRAM pool.

```yaml
base: mlx-community/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-4bit
task: sft
backend: mlx  # Apple Silicon only

data:
  train: ./data/train.jsonl
  format: alpaca

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 2e-5
  lora:
    r: 16
    alpha: 32
```

MLX backend supports SFT. `backend: mlx` with `task: dpo` or `task: grpo` is refused when the config is loaded, with an error naming the task — upstream `mlx-lm` ships no DPO/GRPO training helper, so those wrappers exist only as a backstop for callers that bypass config validation. Requires `mlx-lm >= 0.31.3`. Use `kadhi recipes search --tag mlx` for ready-made Apple Silicon configs.

#### Optimizers and schedules

`training.optimizer`, `training.scheduler`, `training.warmup_ratio` and
`training.weight_decay` are honoured on the MLX backend
(#686). Before that they
were validated, accepted and dropped — every run built a bare AdamW at a
constant learning rate, whatever the recipe said.

Because they are honoured rather than ignored, a setting MLX cannot express is
now **refused when the optimizer is built**, rather than silently substituted:

| setting | MLX accepts | otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| `optimizer` | `adamw_torch`, `adamw_hf`, `adamw_torch_fused`, `sgd`, `adafactor`, `adagrad`, `rmsprop`, `muon` | refused by name, listing what is available |
| `scheduler` | `cosine`, `linear`, `constant`, `constant_with_warmup` | refused, naming the old constant-rate behaviour |
| `weight_decay` | any value on every optimizer above except `adagrad` and `rmsprop` | a non-zero value on `adagrad` / `rmsprop` is refused — those MLX constructors take no `weight_decay`, and dropping it silently is the defect above |

Kadhi's optimizer allowlist (`utils.optimizer_zoo`) is far wider than anything
MLX ships, so most valid values have no MLX equivalent. Run those recipes on
the transformers backend.

The schedule counts **optimizer updates**, not iterations: mlx-lm calls
`optimizer.update()` once every `gradient_accumulation_steps`, so a warmup of
`warmup_ratio × (iters // gradient_accumulation_steps)` is what actually runs.
The effective plan is written to `adapter_config.json` (`optimizer`,
`scheduler`, `warmup_updates`, `total_updates`, `weight_decay`, `peak_lr`), so
what ran is recoverable from the output directory.

`--resume auto` finds mlx-lm's step-numbered `NNNNNNN_adapters.safetensors` checkpoints and warm-starts the LoRA weights from them (#634). This restores adapter weights only, not training state: mlx-lm's LoRA trainer exposes no optimizer state or step count, so training restarts from step 0 regardless of how far the checkpoint got. See [Resume Training](#resume-training) below for the MLX-specific checkpoint shape.

### Transformers on MPS

The regular `backend: transformers` path can run more than MLX's SFT-only
surface. On a live MPS runtime that accepts bfloat16, Kadhi enables BF16 autocast
for the hardware-validated text trainers: SFT, DPO, GRPO/RLVR, reward modelling,
and PRM.
The decision comes from a live MPS allocation probe rather than a macOS version
guess. CPU and an unavailable or older MPS runtime remain in FP32; FP16 is not
selected on MPS.

For BF16 checkpoints, resident SFT, DPO, GRPO, and reward-model runs preserve
the frozen base weights in BF16 while keeping LoRA parameters in FP32. PRM uses
BF16 autocast but deliberately retains FP32 master weights: loading its
trainable base in BF16 makes the Metal optimizer abort because its accumulator
and destination matrix dtypes differ. This policy was validated with one-step
runs on Apple Silicon for all five tasks. GRPO validation uses local
Transformers generation (`use_vllm: false`) and deterministic RLVR; vLLM remains
a CUDA-oriented optional path. Other Transformers trainers remain FP32 on MPS
until their task-specific kernels receive equivalent hardware coverage.


## Unsloth Backend (2-5x Faster Training)

Use the [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) backend for significantly faster training and up to 80% less VRAM:

```bash
# Install unsloth support
pip install "kadhi-cli[fast]"
```

Then add one line to your config:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: sft
backend: unsloth  # 2-5x faster, -80% VRAM

data:
  train: ./data/train.jsonl
  format: alpaca

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 2e-5
  quantization: 4bit
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
```

Works with all training tasks: SFT, DPO, GRPO, PPO, KTO, ORPO, SimPO, IPO, and Pretrain. If unsloth is installed but not enabled, Kadhi will suggest it automatically.

> **Tip:** Kadhi auto-detects unsloth. When installed, you'll see a hint during `kadhi train` if you haven't enabled it yet.


## Cloud GPU Training

No local GPU? `kadhi train --cloud modal|lambda` renders a provider-specific controller
from your `kadhi.yaml`. The config YAML is base64-embedded as **data**; credentials are read from
the environment only when a live submission starts.

```bash
pip install "kadhi-cli[modal]"   # only needed for live submit

# Plan-only (default): write the stub + print the `modal run` command.
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --cloud modal --gpu a100

# Submit live (authenticate once with `modal setup`, or set
# MODAL_TOKEN_ID + MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET).
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --cloud modal --gpu a100 --cloud-submit
```

`--gpu` accepts: `t4` / `l4` / `a10g` / `a100` / `a100-80gb` / `l40s` / `h100`. The rendered
`kadhi_modal_app.py` builds an image with `kadhi-cli[train]` pinned to your running version, writes
the embedded config inside the container, and runs `kadhi train` on the chosen GPU.

### RunPod (Planned)

RunPod support is currently in development and descoped from live CLI dispatch pending automated
lifecycle and termination safeguards. Running `kadhi train --cloud runpod` informs the operator that
RunPod is not yet live and points to active cloud backends (`--cloud modal` and `--cloud lambda`).

### Lambda Cloud

Lambda uses an instance rather than a serverless function. The generated local controller sends a
secret-free cloud-init script as API `user_data`, waits for it over SSH, copies the configured
output back, and requests instance termination in a `finally` block. Keep the controller running
until it reports that termination succeeded; shutting down the guest does not terminate billing.

Register the public half of an SSH key with Lambda first, then set:

```bash
export LAMBDA_API_KEY=...
export LAMBDA_SSH_KEY_NAME=my-lambda-key
export LAMBDA_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=/path/to/private-key
export LAMBDA_REGION=us-tx-1  # optional; defaults to us-tx-1
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --cloud lambda --gpu a100 --cloud-submit
```

`--gpu` accepts: `a10` / `a100` / `a6000` / `h100`. Lambda output paths must be relative so the
controller can copy the artifact back safely. The API key stays on the caller and is never embedded
in cloud-init or instance logs.

The Lambda submission path still requires the paid live-validation checklist in #264 before
it can be described as provider-validated. Plan-only rendering and the lifecycle boundaries are
covered by offline tests.


## Chat with your model

```bash
# Chat with a LoRA adapter (auto-detects base model)
kadhi chat --model ./output

# Specify base model explicitly
kadhi chat --model ./output --base meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

# Adjust generation
kadhi chat --model ./output --temperature 0.3 --max-tokens 256
```


## Push to HuggingFace

```bash
# Upload model to HF Hub
kadhi push --model ./output --repo your-username/my-model

# Make it private
kadhi push --model ./output --repo your-username/my-model --private

# Group into a Collection
kadhi push --model ./output --repo your-username/my-model \
    --collection your-username/my-collection-abc123
```


## HuggingFace Hub Deep Integration

Kadhi treats HF Hub as a first-class artifact backend. One env var, one flag,
no token flags to plumb — all operations respect `huggingface-cli login`
credentials by default.

```bash
# Self-hosted Hub: set once, every command routes there.
export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf.internal.example.com

# Auto-push each save_steps checkpoint to HF as a 'checkpoint-<N>' branch.
kadhi train -c kadhi.yaml --push-as your-username/my-model

# Resume from the latest branch pushed above.
kadhi train -c kadhi.yaml --push-as your-username/my-model --hf-resume

# Upload a local JSONL file as an HF dataset repo.
kadhi data push --input train.jsonl --hf-dataset your-username/my-dataset

# Wrap your fine-tuned model in a Gradio chat Space in one command.
kadhi deploy hf-space \
    --model your-username/my-model \
    --space your-username/my-chat-space \
    --template gradio-chat

# Or a Streamlit app:
kadhi deploy hf-space \
    --model your-username/my-model \
    --space your-username/my-chat-space \
    --template streamlit-chat
```

**Auto-resume workflow:** if training crashes, the next `kadhi train ... --push-as
... --hf-resume` call picks up the latest `checkpoint-<N>` branch from your HF
repo and downloads it back to `output_dir`, then resumes — no manual copy /
paste of checkpoint paths. Cwd containment and `local_dir_use_symlinks=False`
prevent filesystem escape from a crafted repo.

**Auth** follows standard HF conventions: `HF_TOKEN` env var > `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN`
> `~/.cache/huggingface/token` (set by `huggingface-cli login`) > `~/.huggingface/token`.
No custom token flags. The deprecated `--token` on `kadhi push` still works but emits
a warning.

**Model card v2** is auto-generated on first push: it reads sidecar
`training_config.yaml` / `kadhi.yaml` to surface `task` / `base` / `lr` /
`optimizer`, and accepts an optional eval scorecard (markdown table).
Markdown-active chars in task names and scores are neutralised for safe
rendering on HF Hub.


## Resume Training

Resume a training run from a checkpoint:

```bash
# Auto-detect latest checkpoint in output directory
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --resume auto

# Resume from a specific checkpoint
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --resume ./output/checkpoint-500
```

`backend: mlx` writes and resumes a different checkpoint shape: a
step-numbered `NNNNNNN_adapters.safetensors` file (or the final
`adapters.safetensors`) directly under `output`, not a `checkpoint-N`
directory. `--resume auto` and `--resume ./output/0011800_adapters.safetensors`
both work; `--resume ./output/checkpoint-500` does not, because MLX never
writes that shape. This is a weights-only warm start — mlx-lm's LoRA trainer
exposes no optimizer state or step count, so the resumed run starts counting
from step 0 regardless of how far the checkpoint got.


## Run Management & Cleanup

LLM training generates massive checkpoint files. Kadhi automatically manages an SQLite database of your training loss and metrics, empowering you to safely reclaim disk space once training is complete.

```bash
# List all historical training runs
kadhi runs list

# Compare two differing experiments side-by-side
kadhi runs compare run_202611... run_202612...

# Intelligently clean up redundant checkpoints
# (Preserves the final model and the checkpoint with the lowest loss)
kadhi runs clean run_202611...

# Preview space that would be reclaimed across ALL experiments
kadhi runs clean --all --dry-run
```

By default, the `clean` command operates in "surgical mode" (`--keep-weights`), deleting huge optimizer state files (`optimizer.pt`) from lesser checkpoints to save gigabytes, but keeping their lightweight evaluation weights just in case you want to load them later.


## Alternative Model Hubs

Set `training.hub` in your `kadhi.yaml` to download from / push to a non-HuggingFace hub. Useful in regions where HF Hub is unreachable or blocked.

```yaml
training:
  hub: modelscope   # or 'modelers' (Openmind), default 'hf'
```

Override the endpoint via env var:

```bash
export MODELSCOPE_ENDPOINT=https://my-mirror.example.com
export MODELERS_ENDPOINT=https://corp-modelers.internal   # HTTPS only for non-loopback
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml
```

The endpoint validator follows the same SSRF rules as `HF_ENDPOINT`: only `http`/`https` schemes; plain HTTP allowed only for `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `::1`; private and link-local IPs (RFC1918, 169.254/16, etc.) rejected on plain HTTP. `backend: mlx` is incompatible with non-HF hubs (`mlx-lm` only downloads from HF Hub).

ModelScope and Modelers downloads and uploads route through live, lazy-imported SDK adapters. The
HF path remains the default, and MLX remains HF-only.


## TensorBoard Integration

Log training metrics to TensorBoard for local visualization:

```bash
# Enable TensorBoard logging (requires: pip install tensorboard)
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --tensorboard

# View logs
tensorboard --logdir ./output/runs/
```

> **Note:** `--tensorboard` and `--wandb` cannot be used together. Pick one.


## Weights & Biases Integration

Send training metrics to [W&B](https://wandb.ai/) for cloud-based experiment tracking:

```bash
# Enable W&B logging (requires: pip install wandb)
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --wandb
```

Make sure `WANDB_API_KEY` is set or run `wandb login` first.


## Ready-Made Recipes

80 pre-built configs for popular models — no guessing hyperparameters:

```bash
# List all recipes
kadhi recipes list

# Preview a recipe
kadhi recipes show llama3.1-8b-sft

# Use a recipe (writes kadhi.yaml)
kadhi recipes use llama3.1-8b-sft

# Search by task or keyword
kadhi recipes search --task grpo
kadhi recipes search "reasoning"

## Hyperparameter Sweep

Search for the best hyperparameters:

```bash
# Grid search over learning rate and LoRA rank
kadhi sweep --config kadhi.yaml --param lr=1e-5,2e-5,5e-5 --param lora_r=8,16,32

# Random search with max runs
kadhi sweep --config kadhi.yaml --param lr=1e-5,2e-5,5e-5 --strategy random --max-runs 5

# Preview without running — validates first (#642): an unknown config key is
# refused exactly as `train --dry-run` refuses it, and a --param naming no
# config field exits non-zero before any grid is printed
kadhi sweep --config kadhi.yaml --param lr=1e-5,2e-5 --param epochs=2,3 --dry-run

# Early stopping: skip remaining runs if loss exceeds 1.5x best
kadhi sweep --config kadhi.yaml --param lr=1e-5,2e-5,5e-5 --early-stop 1.5
```


## Model Comparison

Compare outputs of two models side-by-side:

```bash
# Compare with inline prompts
kadhi diff --model-a ./model_v1 --model-b ./model_v2 --prompt "Explain gravity"

# Compare with a prompts file
kadhi diff --model-a ./base --model-b ./finetuned --prompts test_prompts.jsonl

# Save results
kadhi diff --model-a ./a --model-b ./b --prompts prompts.txt --output results.jsonl
```


## Quickstart Demo

Run a complete demo in one command — creates sample data, config, and trains a tiny model:

```bash
# Full demo (creates data + config + trains TinyLlama)
kadhi quickstart

# Just create files without training
kadhi quickstart --dry-run

# Skip confirmation
kadhi quickstart --yes
```


## Health Check

Check your environment for compatibility issues:

```bash
kadhi doctor [--nccl]
```

Shows: Python version, GPU availability, system resources (RAM/Disk), all dependency versions, and fix suggestions. Use `--nccl` to measure and check multi-GPU communication bandwidth against expected hardware ceilings.


## Version Info

```bash
# Basic version
kadhi version

# Machine-readable output
kadhi version --json
# -> {"version": "0.26.0", "python": "3.11.5", "platform": "linux"}

# Full system info (useful for bug reports)
kadhi version --full
# -> kadhi v0.26.0 | Python 3.11.5 | CUDA 12.1 | extras: serve, data

# Full system info in JSON
kadhi version --full --json
# -> {"version": "0.26.0", "python": "3.11.5", "platform": "linux", "torch": "2.2.0", ...}
```


## Error Handling

Kadhi shows friendly error messages by default (2-3 lines with a fix suggestion). For full tracebacks:

```bash
# Global flag goes BEFORE the command
kadhi --verbose train --config kadhi.yaml

# Works with any command
kadhi --verbose eval --model ./output --benchmarks mmlu
```

> **Note:** `--verbose` is a global flag — it must go **before** the command name, not after.


## Unknown config keys

Every config model used to run with Pydantic's default `extra="ignore"`, so a key the
schema did not declare was dropped without a word. `kadhi train --dry-run` printed
"Config valid. Ready to train!", the run exited 0, and the requested setting was simply
never applied — `quantizaton: none` trained 4-bit quantized when full precision was
what you asked for, `gradient_checkpoint: true` did no checkpointing, `max_len: 512`
truncated at 2048.

Loading a config now refuses every key it cannot place, in **one** report per load,
with the field you probably meant:

```
Config validation error:

  unknown config key 'data.max_len' - did you mean 'max_length' or 'video_maxlen'? Refused.
unknown config key 'training.quantizaton' - did you mean 'quantization' or 'quantization_aware'? Refused.
```

**Since v0.75 an unknown config key refuses the load.** v0.74 shipped the same report
as a warning that named this deadline, so there was exactly one release of notice —
deliberately, because a config written against a newer Kadhi has to keep running on an
older wheel for at least one release. The refusal is the same everywhere a `KadhiConfig`
is built from a file or a string: `kadhi train` exits 1 before the training stack is
imported, `kadhi sweep` / `kadhi doctor --config` / `kadhi ship --config` / `kadhi plan` /
`kadhi apply` refuse the same way, and the Web UI / API loader raises `ValueError` with
the same text (the Web UI shows it). Nothing is defaulted and nothing is guessed: the
suggestion is a hint for you, not a substitution the loader makes. A root-level `lora:`
block is not an unknown key — the schema has accepted that spelling and moved it under
`training` since v0.40.1, and the detector applies the same remap before it looks.

A config that names a key your installed Kadhi does not have usually means one of two
things: a typo (take the suggestion), or a field added after your version shipped
(`kadhi version` against the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md) will say which). A config
that must stay loadable on v0.74 as well needs the key removed, not renamed — v0.74
warns and ignores it, v0.75 refuses it, and neither applies it.

**`kadhi sweep` never had the warning period.** A `--param` that matches no config
field has been a hard error since v0.74:

```bash
kadhi sweep --config kadhi.yaml --param lora_rank=8,16   # the field is training.lora.r
# sweep parameter does not match any config field: unknown config key 'lora_rank' - refused.
echo $?   # 1
```

The whole sweep is refused before the first arm starts, and the command exits non-zero, so
a scripted or CI-driven sweep fails rather than reporting a grid of arms that each failed
for the same reason. A sweep whose swept knob is never applied produces arms that are all
identical, so there is no partially-useful result to preserve by continuing.


## Experiment Tracking

Every `kadhi train` run is automatically tracked in a local SQLite database (`~/.kadhi/experiments.db`).

```bash
# List all training runs
kadhi runs

# Show detailed info + loss curve for a run
kadhi runs show run_20260223_143052_a1b2

# Compare two runs side by side
kadhi runs compare run_1 run_2

# Delete a run
kadhi runs delete run_1

# Replay an old run's summary + loss curve from history
kadhi runs replay run_1
```

Every completed run also stores an estimated cost (`$` per run) computed from the
captured GPU device name and duration. `kadhi runs show` renders `—` for CPU /
MPS / unknown GPUs (no fabricated zeros).

As of v0.71.5, the metric-series lookup that powers replay (`ExperimentTracker.get_metric_series`)
transparently falls back to the `eval_results` table when a metric has no per-step
rows — so you can plot a benchmark-score curve (e.g. `mmlu`, `gsm8k`) the same way
you plot `loss`, without caring which table holds the series.

### Tracker integrations (--tracker mlflow / swanlab / trackio)

```bash
# Stream metrics to MLflow (set MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI to your server URL)
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --tracker mlflow

# Or SwanLab (cloud or local)
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --tracker swanlab

# Or Trackio (offline-friendly batched upload)
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --tracker trackio
```

`--tracker` is mutually exclusive with `--wandb` and `--tensorboard`. Kadhi
validates the tracker name against a closed allowlist (`mlflow` / `swanlab` /
`trackio` / `wandb` / `tensorboard` / `none`); the upstream package itself is
loaded by HF Trainer at run time, so install the one you need separately:

```bash
pip install mlflow      # or: swanlab / trackio
```

### Telemetry (opt-in)

Kadhi ships a hardware-info-only telemetry payload (Kadhi version + command +
Python major.minor + OS + arch + duration + anonymous distinct ID). It is **off by default** and never
sends model names, dataset paths, or config contents.

To opt in, set the environment variable:

```bash
KADHI_TELEMETRY=1 kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml
```

When `KADHI_TELEMETRY` is unset, `0`, or any value other than `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`, Kadhi performs
zero telemetry network requests.

You can also explicitly disable telemetry for a specific invocation using the `--no-telemetry` flag:

```bash
kadhi train --config kadhi.yaml --no-telemetry
```

When enabled, telemetry performs a synchronous fire-and-forget HTTP POST with a 1-second connect and read timeout (DNS resolution excluded) on command exit. The anonymous identifier is stored at `~/.kadhi/telemetry_id`; deleting `~/.kadhi/telemetry_id` regenerates it on the next opt-in. See [Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy) for details.


## Profiling Extras

CUDA memory snapshots, anomaly tracing, and an NCCL bandwidth reference table:

```python
from kadhi_cli.utils.profiling_v0_43 import (
    memory_snapshot_context, detect_anomaly_context, nccl_bandwidth_check,
)

with memory_snapshot_context("run-123") as path:
    train_step()
    # On CUDA, dumps profiles/run-123.snapshot.pickle on exit.

with detect_anomaly_context():
    train_step()
    # torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(True)

result = nccl_bandwidth_check(
    gpu="h100", link="nvlink", measured_gb_per_sec=400.0,
)
# {'expected_gb_per_sec': 450.0, 'measured_gb_per_sec': 400.0,
#  'ratio': 0.8889, 'status': 'OK'}
```


## VS Code Setup (`.vscode/launch.json`)

One-shot writer for a sane debugger config:

```python
from kadhi_cli.utils.vscode_setup import write_vscode_launch
write_vscode_launch(config_path="kadhi.yaml")
# Writes ./.vscode/launch.json with `kadhi train` + pytest entries.
```

Symlink-rejected at the target path regardless of `force=True` to defend
against pre-placed symlinks redirecting the write outside cwd.


## Observability & Dev UX

Tools that explain *why* a run misbehaved instead of dumping a stack trace.

### `kadhi why`

Heuristic explainer — reads the most recent (or named) run and surfaces
plain-English diagnoses with concrete next steps.

```bash
kadhi why                 # most recent run
kadhi why run_2026_abc    # specific run id (or prefix)
```

Detects: NaN/Inf loss, plateau (≥30 steps with <0.5% change), divergence
(loss > 3× initial), persistent high gradient norm, learning rate outside the
typical `[1e-6, 5e-3]` band. Pure rule-based — no model calls.

### `kadhi tui`

Full-screen Textual dashboard. Two-pane: run list (left) + selected-run detail
(right). `r` refreshes, `q` quits.

```bash
pip install "kadhi-cli[tui]"
kadhi tui --refresh 1.0 --limit 50
```

### Auto-profiling — `kadhi train --profile`

Records a `torch.profiler` Chrome-trace over an early-steps window (default
`wait=1, warmup=1, active=5, repeat=1`). Output: `<output>/profiles/<run_id>.trace.json`.
Open in `chrome://tracing` or Perfetto.

### Crash bundles — `.crash` files

When training fails, Kadhi auto-writes a self-contained `.crash` JSON to
`./.kadhi-crashes/crash_<utc>_<hex>.crash` containing: redacted error trace,
classified failure kind (`oom` / `nan` / `cuda` / `dataloader` / `nccl` /
`other`), GPU state at crash time, env summary, last-50 metric rows, and the
config (recursively redacted of `hf_*` / `sk-*` / `Bearer …` tokens). The
output_dir is reduced to `os.path.basename` so `$HOME` doesn't leak.

### `--log-level quiet|normal|verbose|debug`

Global flag on the root `kadhi` command. Wires a Rich-formatted logger on the
`kadhi` namespace; `debug` enables timestamps + module paths.

```bash
kadhi --log-level verbose train --config kadhi.yaml
kadhi --log-level debug runs show <id>
```


## GPU Live Monitor

```bash
kadhi monitor                # 2s refresh, Util / Mem / VRAM / Temp / Power per GPU
kadhi monitor --refresh 0.5  # faster polling
kadhi monitor --once         # single snapshot, no Live panel
```

On NVIDIA systems, Kadhi calls `nvidia-smi` via a list-args subprocess (no shell)
with a 5-second timeout. On Apple Silicon, it reads GPU utilization and power
from `/usr/bin/powermetrics --samplers gpu_power --format plist`. Run `sudo -v`
in a terminal before starting the monitor: Kadhi uses `sudo -n`, so it can reuse
the cached credential without ever prompting for or reading a password. If the
credential or utility is unavailable, the command exits with an Activity
Monitor fallback rather than reporting an NVIDIA error.

macOS does not expose NVIDIA-style dedicated VRAM, memory-utilization, or GPU
temperature fields through this sampler. Those columns therefore remain `—`
instead of guessing values from unified memory or unrelated thermal sensors.


## Kadhi Fetch — Bundled Examples

```bash
kadhi fetch examples                          # list bundled entries
kadhi fetch examples llama-3.1-8b-lora        # write to ./llama-3.1-8b-lora.yaml
kadhi fetch examples qwen2.5-7b-dpo -o ./my-config.yaml --force
kadhi fetch deepspeed_configs zero3-cpu-offload
```

Closed catalog (`MappingProxyType`) of ready-to-edit YAML / JSON. Output path cwd-contained, bundled-source `os.path.commonpath` check (defends against catalog escape), `os.lstat + S_ISLNK` symlink-reject at the write target.


## Llama 4 Delinearizer

```bash
kadhi delinearize-llama4 ./llama4-checkpoint --target ./out-delinearized [--num-experts N] [--plan-only]
```

LIVE (v0.71.21): reshapes fused Llama-4 expert weights `[E*din, dout]` → `[E, din, dout]` shard-by-shard (atomic writes, per-shard 16 GiB cap, cwd containment) and copies the JSON sidecars so the target stays loadable. The expert count defaults from `config.json` (`text_config.num_local_experts`); pass `--num-experts` when the config doesn't carry it (exit 2 otherwise). `--plan-only` keeps the original preview flow and writes nothing. `is_llama4_model` uses a word-boundary regex matching the `is_gemma4_model` pattern — `ungemma-llama-4ish` is rejected.


## Ctrl+C Graceful Save

First SIGINT → trainer writes a checkpoint and continues. Second SIGINT → trainer stops cleanly after the next save. No-state fallback raises `KeyboardInterrupt` so the user never gets stuck. `GracefulSaveHandler.install()` is idempotent and swallows `signal.signal` failures on non-main threads.


## Checkpoint-Now Trigger File

```bash
touch ./out/.checkpoint_now    # trainer saves on the next step, then deletes the trigger
```

Path containment via `is_under_cwd`; `os.lstat + S_ISLNK` rejection at the trigger target so a pre-placed symlink can't redirect the write.


## Onboarding Wizard Helper

```python
from kadhi_cli.utils.onboarding import render_onboarding_yaml

text = render_onboarding_yaml({
    "base": "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B",
    "dataset": "./train.jsonl",
    "task": "sft",
    "quantization": "4bit",
    "epochs": 3,
})
```

Five-question wizard input → fully-validated `kadhi.yaml`. Literal allowlists on `task` (`sft` / `dpo` / `kto` / `orpo` / `simpo` / `ipo` / `bco` / `preference`) and `quantization` (`4bit` / `8bit` / `none`); `epochs ∈ [1, 10]`; `output` cwd-contained; null-byte rejection on every string.


## Standalone Sweep Config

```bash
kadhi sweep --config sweep.yaml
```

```yaml
# sweep.yaml
strategy: random
n_runs: 20
seed: 42
params:
  lr: [0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001]
  epochs: [1, 3, 5]
```

Strict scalar allowlist on values (`str` / `int` / `float` / `bool`); `_MAX_FILE_BYTES=256KB`, `_MAX_PARAM_KEYS=32`, `_MAX_VALUES_PER_KEY=64`; `SweepSpec.params` is `MappingProxyType[str, Tuple[Any, ...]]` for genuine immutability.


## Alternative Model Hubs (ModelScope / Modelers)

Set `training.hub` to fetch the base model from a non-HF Hub:

```yaml
base: baichuan-inc/Baichuan2-7B
task: sft
training:
  hub: modelscope     # or "modelers"
```

`kadhi train` pre-fetches the model into `./.kadhi_hub_cache/<sanitized-slug>/` via the matching SDK (`modelscope.snapshot_download` / `openmind_hub.snapshot_download`) and rewrites `cfg.base` to the local snapshot. Re-runs reuse the cached snapshot. Both `huggingface-hub`, `modelscope`, and `openmind-hub` are lazy-imported — install only what you need.

Programmatic API:

```python
from kadhi_cli.utils.hubs import download_repo, upload_repo

local_path = download_repo("modelscope", "baichuan-inc/Baichuan2-7B", local_dir="./snap")
upload_repo("modelers", "my-org/my-model", folder_path="./output", commit_message="Kadhi v0.53.8")
```

The dispatcher enforces shape validation on every input (bool / null-byte / leading-slash / `..` segments / control characters / oversize all rejected) and runs cwd-containment on `local_dir` / `folder_path`.


## Experiment Trackers (MLflow / SwanLab / Trackio)

Pick a tracker on the CLI; Kadhi threads it into HF Trainer's `report_to`:

```bash
kadhi train --tracker mlflow
kadhi train --tracker swanlab
kadhi train --tracker trackio
```

If the package is not installed, Kadhi now surfaces a friendly advisory before training starts instead of a mid-run ImportError:

```
--tracker mlflow requires the 'mlflow' package. Install with: pip install kadhi-cli[trackers] (or pip install mlflow)
```

```bash
pip install kadhi-cli[trackers]   # mlflow + swanlab + trackio
```


## Telemetry & Privacy Policy

Kadhi contains opt-in, hardware-info-only telemetry in `utils/trackers.py` (`build_telemetry_payload` / `send_telemetry_payload`).

### Privacy Policy

Kadhi's telemetry is strictly anonymous and hardware-focused. When opted in via `KADHI_TELEMETRY=1`, we collect only the following fields to understand what environments we need to support:

- `kadhi_version`: the version of Kadhi being run
- `command`: the top-level command executed (e.g. `train`, `data`, validated against known commands; unknown commands or paths are masked as `(unknown)`)
- `python`: Python major.minor version
- `os`: OS platform name (`platform.system()`)
- `arch`: System architecture (`platform.machine()`)
- `duration_seconds`: Command execution duration in seconds
- `distinct_id`: Anonymous UUID4 generated locally on first run and stored at `~/.kadhi/telemetry_id` to deduplicate events. Deleting `~/.kadhi/telemetry_id` regenerates it on the next opt-in.

We **NEVER** collect:
- Dataset paths or contents
- Model names or architectures
- Config file contents or hyperparameters
- Usernames, local file paths, or directory names
- IP addresses, tokens, or credentials

All uploads use HTTPS, a 1-second connect and read timeout (DNS resolution excluded), and defensive SSRF validation. Any network or filesystem exception is silently swallowed so telemetry can never fail or interrupt your work.


## Plugin System

Kadhi discovers bundled modules under `kadhi_cli.plugins` and installed Python
distributions that publish the `kadhi_cli.plugins` entry-point group. An external
plugin exposes a zero-argument registration function:

```python
from kadhi_cli.plugins import register_plugin

class MyPlugin:
    def pre_train(self, ctx):
        ...
    def post_train(self, ctx):
        ...

def register():
    register_plugin(
        name="my-plugin",
        version="1.0.0",
        plugin=MyPlugin(),
        description="Hooks into pre/post-train",
        templates=["my-template"],         # optional metadata
        model_groups=["my-arch-family"],   # optional metadata
    )
```

Declare it in the plugin distribution's `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."kadhi_cli.plugins"]
my-plugin = "my_package.kadhi_plugin:register"
```

Bundled Kadhi plugin modules are enabled by default. Installed third-party entry points
are **disabled by default**: discovery reads their names and versions from package
metadata without importing or executing their modules. `kadhi plugins enable <name>` is
the explicit boundary that loads the selected entry point; its entry-point name must
match the plugin name it registers. The choice is stored atomically in
`~/.kadhi/plugins.json` and is reused by later Kadhi processes.

Set `KADHI_PLUGIN_STATE_PATH` to use a different trusted local state file, for example in
an isolated test environment. This explicit path is not confined to the current
workspace; Kadhi rejects NULs, oversized paths, symlink state files, oversized content,
and malformed JSON.

```bash
kadhi plugins                       # discover and list plugins
kadhi plugins enable my-plugin      # opt in persistently
kadhi plugins disable my-plugin
```

`kadhi plugins install` deliberately exits with status 2: Kadhi does not run a package
installer on the user's behalf. Install the distribution with your trusted Python
package workflow, then enable it explicitly.

Plugin names are kebab-case (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,39}$`); versions are semver-ish (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`); registry caps `_MAX_PLUGINS=64`, `_MAX_TEMPLATES_PER_PLUGIN=32`, `_MAX_MODEL_GROUPS_PER_PLUGIN=32`. Re-registering the same `(name, version, plugin, templates, model_groups, description)` is idempotent; any field mismatch is rejected with a clear error. `templates` and `model_groups` are descriptive metadata surfaced by `kadhi plugins`; Kadhi does not apply them to model configuration automatically.


## External Integrations Catalog

```python
from kadhi_cli.utils.integrations import list_integrations, get_integration

list_integrations()                       # 15 entries
get_integration("lm-studio").target_artifacts   # ("gguf",)
```

15 ecosystem targets covered: `lm-studio`, `comfyui`, `stable-diffusion-cpp`, `open-webui`, `ollama`, `tei`, `pgvector`, `faiss`, `weaviate`, `sentence-transformers`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `continue`, `cline`, `sillytavern`. Auto-detect + launch wiring lands with v0.46.0 Deploy Autopilot.


## Advanced Trainer Plugins

```python
from kadhi_cli.utils.trainer_plugins import validate_trainer_plugin_list

validate_trainer_plugin_list(["grokfast", "spectrum"])
# returns ("grokfast", "spectrum") — canonical lowercase, dedup, ≤ 8 entries
```

6-entry allowlist (`cce_plugin`, `grokfast`, `spectrum`, `llmcompressor`, `sonicmoe`, `math_verify`) so a future `training.trainer_plugins: [...]` schema field has a stable surface. Live callbacks in v0.45.1.


## Kadhi Plugin Callbacks

Register a plugin once via the v0.45.0 registry API; v0.53.6 wires it into every
transformer-backend trainer as a real HF `TrainerCallback`:

```python
# my_package/kadhi_plugin.py — discovered only by plugin-aware commands/training
from kadhi_cli.plugins import register_plugin

class MyPlugin:
    def pre_train(self, ctx):
        print("training about to start, args =", ctx["args"])

    def post_step(self, ctx):
        if ctx["state"].global_step % 100 == 0:
            print(f"step {ctx['state'].global_step}")

def register():
    register_plugin(name="my-plugin", version="0.1.0", plugin=MyPlugin())
```

A misbehaving plugin hook is swallowed at WARNING — one bad plugin must never crash
a multi-hour training run. The hook snapshot is taken at callback-construction time,
so a plugin registered MID-run does not retroactively receive events. Discovery is
lazy, so importing the CLI or running an unrelated light command does not load plugin
entry points.


## Terraform-Style Plan & Apply (`kadhi plan` / `kadhi apply`)

A training run is a one-shot infrastructure-shaped operation: spot price, expected cost, base SHA, dataset SHA, peak VRAM. v0.64 borrows Terraform's plan-apply split so you can review the numbers before committing money.

```bash
# Render a pre-flight summary + write kadhi.tfstate
kadhi plan --config kadhi.yaml

# Apply — refuses on drift (exit 3) if the YAML changed since `plan`
kadhi apply --config kadhi.yaml

# Validate without actually running anything
kadhi apply --config kadhi.yaml --dry-run
```

The state file is a thin JSON envelope; the actual training is still driven by `kadhi train`. The gate prevents the "wait, why did I spend another $0.50 on the wrong config" surprise.


## Hermetic Env Lockfile (`kadhi env`)

The "CUDA hell" problem: a fine-tune that worked on Friday breaks on Monday because PyPI silently upgraded `transformers` past the trainer's compat band. v0.34 `kadhi doctor` surfaces some of this; v0.64 makes it lockable.

```bash
# Snapshot the current env into kadhi-env.lock
kadhi env lock

# Print the locked env summary
kadhi env status

# Compare current env to the lock — exit 3 on ABI-sensitive drift
kadhi env check
```

`kadhi-env.lock` captures Python + platform + CUDA + 15 ABI-sensitive packages (torch / transformers / peft / trl / accelerate / bitsandbytes / flash-attn / xformers / deepspeed / unsloth / vllm / sentencepiece / tokenizers / datasets / huggingface-hub). Wire `kadhi env check` into your CI to refuse silent ABI breakage.


## Hardware-Fit Calculator

Given (params, seq_len, batch_size, optimizer, quant, peft, gradient_checkpointing), the analytical predictor returns a 5-bucket peak-VRAM breakdown (weights / optimizer / gradients / activations / overhead) and an OK/OOM verdict with a 10% safety margin.

```python
from kadhi_cli.utils.hardware_fit import HardwareFitInput, decide_hardware_fit

inp = HardwareFitInput(
    params_b=7.0, seq_len=2048, batch_size=4,
    optimizer="adamw_torch", quant="4bit", peft="lora",
    gradient_checkpointing=True,
)
report = decide_hardware_fit(inp, available_vram_gb=24.0)
print(report.ok, report.reason)
# True | 'fits: peak 7.76 GB + 10% margin <= 24.00 GB available'
```

When it doesn't fit, the report names actionable knobs: `--batch-size halve`, `--quantization 4bit`, `--gradient-checkpointing auto`. Composes with v0.40.3 live CUDA OOM probe (`make_cuda_probe_fn`) which still runs when `auto_batch_size_strategy: probe`.

The weights bucket assumes 2 bytes/param under `quant="none"` (a frozen base now really does load at the checkpoint's own dtype, typically bf16/fp16 — #339), except `peft="full"` (full fine-tuning), which explicitly loads fp32 master weights and so assumes 4 bytes/param instead.


## Shell Completions (`kadhi completions`)

Tab-completion for `kadhi` + every subcommand. The generated script is Click/Typer-backed so new commands are picked up automatically.

```bash
# Bash
eval "$(kadhi completions bash)"        # current shell
kadhi completions bash >> ~/.bashrc     # permanent

# Zsh
kadhi completions zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_kadhi"

# Fish
kadhi completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/kadhi.fish
```

Recipe names auto-complete from the 115+ catalogue; `--target-modules` falls back to canonical Llama-shape defaults (`q_proj` / `k_proj` / `v_proj` / etc.). Live HF-config introspection per `base` lands in v0.64.1.


## License Advisor (`kadhi license-advisor`)

Picking a license-clean base for a specific deployment target is a recurring legal-review pain point. v0.64 captures the three most common deploy contexts as a closed allowlist and surfaces the per-license downstream risk.

```bash
# What licenses are safe for a B2C consumer product?
kadhi license-advisor --target b2c

# Defense — restricted-use community licenses forbidden
kadhi license-advisor --target defense

# Per-license check: Llama community license + 800M MAU = block (exit 3)
kadhi license-advisor --target b2c --license llama-3 --monthly-active-users 800000000
```

The Llama-family allowlist is tight (no `.startswith` over-match), so a hypothetical future `llama-permissive-2030` won't false-trigger the 700M-MAU gate. Composes with v0.60 `kadhi adapters merge --license <id>` for the merge-time conflict gate.

## Troubleshooting

```bash
kadhi doctor    # GPU, system resources, dependencies, and version in one place
```

- **`ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _C` (Windows).** PyPI's torch
  wheel is CPU-only. Reinstall a CUDA build; `kadhi doctor` prints the
  `pip install` command for the wheel your driver can run.
- **`kadhi version` ≠ `pip show kadhi-cli`** — multiple Python installs; use a virtualenv.
