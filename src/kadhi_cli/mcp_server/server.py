"""MCP server wiring for ``kadhi mcp serve`` (v0.71.28; network transports #296).

This is the ONLY module that imports the ``mcp`` SDK — importing it therefore
requires the ``[mcp]`` extra. The pure tool table lives in
:mod:`kadhi_cli.mcp_server.registry` (no SDK dependency, fully unit-testable).

:func:`build_server` is transport-agnostic; ``stdio`` (v1) and the two
network transports added for #296 (``sse`` / streamable ``http``) all wrap
the same server object. Everything the network transports need beyond the
SDK -- starlette, uvicorn -- is already a hard dependency of ``mcp``.
