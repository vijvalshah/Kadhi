"""Optimizer and LR-schedule construction for the MLX SFT path (#686).

The MLX backend validated ``warmup_ratio``, ``scheduler``, ``weight_decay`` and
``optimizer`` and then built ``optim.AdamW(learning_rate=lr)`` -- a bare scalar.
All four were accepted and dropped without a word, so an MLX run silently
trained a different recipe from the one the config described.

**The step unit is optimizer updates, not iterations.** Measured rather than
assumed: MLX calls a callable ``learning_rate`` with ``optimizer.step``, and
that counter advances once per ``optimizer.update()`` -- which mlx-lm invokes
only when ``it % grad_accumulation_steps == 0``. So a schedule built against
``iters`` would stretch its warmup by a factor of ``grad_accumulation_steps``
and never reach the cosine floor. Everything here counts updates.
