"""Response-only token masking for the MLX SFT path (#683).

``data.train_on_responses_only`` defaults to ``True`` and promises that only
assistant content contributes to the SFT loss. The MLX wrapper passed no mask
at all, so every MLX SFT run trained on system and user turns as well.

The obvious repair -- setting ``mask_prompt`` on the args object that
``mlx_lm.tuner.datasets.create_dataset`` reads -- is correct for
prompt/completion data and **wrong for multi-turn chat**. Upstream's
``ChatDataset`` masks a single prefix ending before ``messages[-1]``
(``datasets.py:65-75``), so on a conversation with two assistant turns it
supervises only the last one and silently drops the first from the loss.
Measured on Qwen2.5 with two assistant turns: 46 supervised tokens before,
4 after, and the 4 are not the ones the contract asks for.

The reason a prefix is all upstream can express is ``default_loss``
(``trainer.py:86-96``), which rebuilds the mask from an ``(offset, length)``
pair -- one contiguous span per sample. Multiple assistant spans are simply not
representable in that pair.

``train()`` takes ``loss`` and ``iterate_batches`` as callables
(``trainer.py:224-225``), so this module supplies a real per-token mask through
those hooks instead: a dataset that emits ``(tokens, mask)``, a batching
function that pads the mask alongside the tokens, and a loss that multiplies by
it. Same ``train()``, same callback, no fork and no vendored upstream code.
