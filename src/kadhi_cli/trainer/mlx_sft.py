"""MLX SFT trainer — Apple Silicon fine-tuning via mlx-lm.

Rewritten for mlx-lm >= 0.31 (v0.73.0 fix, PR #362):
- ``mlx_lm.tuner.trainer.train`` no longer takes a ``tokenizer`` argument;
  datasets are built with ``mlx_lm.tuner.datasets.create_dataset``, wrapped in
  ``CacheDataset`` (bare ``ChatDataset`` lacks ``__len__``/``__getitem__``),
  and loss is reported through ``TrainingCallback.on_train_loss_report``.
- LoRA layers are applied with ``mlx_lm.tuner.utils.linear_to_lora_layers``
  after ``model.freeze()``: ``mlx_lm.load`` does NOT freeze, and without it
  every parameter is trainable and the saved "adapter" is actually a full
  fine-tune (172 tensors vs 24 LoRA tensors on a 1.2B model).
- Implements the CLI trainer contract: ``train()`` accepts the common kwargs
  (display/tracker/run_id/resume_from_checkpoint) and returns the metrics
  dict that ``commands/train.py`` expects.

        layers have been converted.

        This restores adapter WEIGHTS only. mlx-lm's LoRA trainer exposes no
        optimizer state and no step/iteration count, so it is a warm start,
        not a resume of training state: the step count and data position
        both restart from zero regardless of how far the checkpoint got.

        reproducible iteration order tied to training.seed/data_seed, which
        the MLX path does not thread yet (#353) — and is out of scope here.
