"""Shared layer-streaming setup for every trainer wrapper that supports it.

v0.72.4 — extracted verbatim from ``trainer/sft.py`` so that SFT and the four
preference losses (DPO / ORPO / SimPO / KTO) cannot drift. There is exactly one
copy of the NF4 pre-flight, the RAM/disk tier decision, the VRAM fit refusal and
the runtime release; a per-wrapper copy would be five places to fix the next
time any of them is wrong.

The move is behaviour-preserving for SFT by design, so v0.72.0-.3's
bit-exactness gates remain valid without being re-run. The ONE addition is
``_STREAM_ROWS_PER_EXAMPLE``: DPO, ORPO and SimPO build their forward through
TRL's ``concatenated_inputs`` + ``torch.cat``, so 2 x ``batch_size`` rows reach
the model in a single tensor. v0.72.3's VRAM estimator was validated on the
property that it NEVER under-predicts, and budgeting those three at 1x rows
would break exactly that — on Windows the consequence is not an exception but a
silent WDDM spill to host memory that makes the run an order of magnitude
slower with no error at all.

NO top-level torch: this module is imported by five trainer modules.
