"""#755 — declared per-(task, backend) config support.

A field can be declared, validated, documented and still be read by nothing on
the backend you chose. That has been filed one field at a time: #683, #686,
#745, #749.

Which fields a backend honours is **declared here, not inferred**. Three
inference strategies were measured and rejected (see #755): reachability over
the import graph detects none of the known gaps, because every trainer's
transitive closure is most of the package; reads of the trainer module alone
invent gaps for fields that live in helper modules (``train_on_responses_only``
in ``data/sft_format.py``, ``loraplus_lr_ratio`` in the #738 helper); and
``--dry-run`` exits before a trainer is ever constructed, so runtime tracing
observes nothing.

So this table is maintained by review. ``tests/test_issue755_*`` bounds the
drift -- every entry must name a real field, and every dotted field name in
``trainer/mlx_sft.py``'s own warning list must appear here. It cannot originate
the truth; it can only stop it rotting, which is the failure that produced #749.

Scope today: ``task=sft`` on ``backend=mlx``. Other pairs report nothing rather
than guessing, which is the honest default for a table that has not been
reviewed for them.
