#: What to do about a key no model declares (#627).
#:
#: ``"warn"``  -- report and continue. Non-breaking: a config written for a
#:               newer Kadhi still runs on an older one.
#: ``"error"`` -- refuse to load.
#:
#: Detection is identical either way; this is the only difference between the
#: options argued on #627, kept as one switch so the decision is a one-line
#: change rather than a rewrite.
#:
#: The decision was warn-then-forbid. v0.74.0 shipped ``"warn"`` with a
#: deadline named by
#: :data:`~kadhi_cli.config.unknown_keys.UNKNOWN_KEY_REJECTION_VERSION` -- by
#: reference, not by number, because the warning stated that version in
#: exactly one place -- and the release that reached it flipped this to
#: ``"error"``. ``TestTheDeadline`` pins the switch to the declared
#: ``__version__`` in both directions, so it can be neither forgotten nor
#: flipped early.
