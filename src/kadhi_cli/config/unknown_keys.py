"""Detect config keys that no model declares (#627).

Pydantic's default is ``extra="ignore"``, and none of the config models
override it, so a key the schema does not know is dropped in silence. The run
then proceeds with the setting the user asked for simply not applied:
``quantizaton: none`` trains 4-bit quantized, ``gradient_checkpoint: true``
does no checkpointing, ``data.max_len: 512`` truncates at 2048. Each is one
edit away from a real field, which is what makes them likely rather than
exotic.

Each example above is one where the dropped value *differs* from the schema
default, which is the only kind worth printing. ``quantization`` already
defaults to ``"4bit"``, so misspelling that key while asking for the default
is the harmless member of this population -- it reads like a disaster and
changes nothing, which teaches the wrong lesson about what was fixed here.
``TestTheDocumentedExamplesAreOnesThatActuallyBreak`` pins the property
against the live schema, so a later default change cannot quietly make an
example vacuous again.

#623 is the live case: ``training.stream_pin`` reached main two days after
0.73.3 shipped, so a user on the released wheel wrote the documented escape
hatch, ``--dry-run`` reported "Config valid", the key was discarded, and the
resulting OOM was investigated as a layer-streaming defect.

This module is the detection half only. It walks the raw mapping against the
model tree and reports what it cannot place, with a suggestion drawn from the
fields that model actually declares. **What to do about a finding -- raise or
warn -- is the caller's choice**, kept deliberately separate so the severity is
one switch rather than a rewrite.

Pure and dependency-light: stdlib plus the schema. No torch, no I/O, no network,
so it is fully unit-testable on any machine.

#: The release that stops warning about unknown keys and starts refusing them.

#: Written out **once**, here. The loader message, the docs line and the
#: deadline test all read this constant rather than repeating the string,
#: because the failure mode of a duplicate is a message that keeps promising a
#: rejection after the rejection has shipped. ``TestTheDeadline`` asserts it
#: against the declared ``kadhi_cli.__version__`` instead of a literal, so the
#: release that crosses the deadline turns a test red rather than turning the
#: warning into a lie.
#:
#: 0.75 rather than 0.74 because the release carrying *this* warning is v0.74.0
#: itself -- 71 fragments have accumulated since v0.73.3, 18 of them ``added``,
#: which is a minor and not a patch. Naming 0.74 would have given the warning
#: zero releases of notice, which is the outcome the warn-then-forbid decision
#: exists to avoid. One minor of notice: warn in 0.74, refuse in 0.75.
