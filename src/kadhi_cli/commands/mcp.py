"""kadhi mcp - Model Context Protocol server (v0.71.28; network transports #296).

``kadhi mcp serve`` exposes Kadhi's read-only commands (plus two plan-only
mutating tools) to any MCP client (Claude Code / Cursor / Cline / Continue).
stdio remains the default and is unchanged; ``--transport sse`` and
``--transport http`` add a local listener for remote or multi-client setups.
The heavy ``mcp`` SDK is behind the ``[mcp]`` extra and imported lazily, so this
command errors friendly-ly when the extra is missing.

All user-facing help text stays ASCII (Windows terminal / cp1252 safety;
mirrors the ``test_help_output_is_ascii_safe`` guard).
