"""Bundled general-suite registry for ``kadhi ship``'s leg 2 (v0.71.38).

The v0.25.0 leg-2 default was 15 hand-written trivia prompts scored by raw
substring containment (``eval/forgetting``) — decorative. This module makes the
regression gate real: a set of **offline, zero-dep, hand-authored** suites, each
producing a **per-model absolute** score in ``[0, 1]`` from a generator closure,
so ``compute_benchmark_deltas`` can flag a genuine regression.

It composes two families:

- the ``score_answer`` MCQ / arithmetic suites in ``eval/forgetting`` (fixed
  scorer, expanded to ~40 items), scored via ``ForgettingDetector``; and
- three **behavioural** suites — tool-calling, JSON-format, safety/refusal —
  bundled as JSONL fixtures and scored by the pure ``eval/custom`` +
  ``utils/diagnose`` scorers (tool-call name-match, refusal heuristic) plus a
  small container-only JSON check (``_is_json_container`` — a bare scalar is
  valid JSON but not the structured object the suite asks for, so it is new
  here rather than a call into ``diagnose.format.is_valid_json``).

No lm-eval, no network, no torch — the whole surface is CPU-testable and the
``kadhi ci init`` core-only install keeps working.

#316 — two of the three behavioural suites measured NOTHING on a real model.
Measured on an H100 against Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, both were **harness**
defects, not model failures:

- ``mini_tool_call`` scored **0.000/40**. The prompts were bare user questions
  with no tool schema anywhere, so a fully tool-capable model correctly answered
  in prose and 0 of 40 outputs contained any JSON. The fixture now renders a
  candidate tool menu (name + description) ahead of each question, and names the
  ``{"function": {"name": ...}}`` envelope the scorer actually parses. The menu
  is a *selection* task — 8 candidates drawn deterministically from the suite's
  34 tools, excluding near-synonyms of the correct one so a miss means lost
  tool-calling rather than an ambiguous prompt.
- ``mini_format_json`` scored **0.000/40** because 38/40 answers were inside a
  ```json fence and the container check parsed the whole string. Extraction is
  now bounded (see ``_extract_json_container``).
- Both were additionally truncated by a 64-token generation budget; see
  ``BEHAVIOURAL_MAX_NEW_TOKENS``.

A suite pinned at 0.000 contributes nothing to the gate but also cannot *fall*,
which is precisely how the defect stayed invisible. Each repair therefore ships
with a control against the symmetric failure — a schema that hands over the
answer, or an extractor eager enough to pin the suite at 1.000.
