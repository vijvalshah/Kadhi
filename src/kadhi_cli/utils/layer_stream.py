"""training.stream_layers — layer streaming planner (v0.72.0 BETA).

The pure half: tier choice, pinned-vs-pageable decision, the architecture
allowlist, and the VRAM / throughput arithmetic. **No top-level torch** — this
module sits on the light CLI's import path so `kadhi profile` and friends can
forecast a streaming run without pulling in the training stack.

The runtime half (buffer pool, weight source, prefetch scheduler, layer
wrapper) lives in ``layer_stream_runtime.py``; the checkpoint sharder lives in
``layer_shard.py``.

Model of the mechanism: the frozen base lives in CPU RAM and is streamed into a
small pool of pre-allocated VRAM buffers one decoder layer at a time. Vocabulary
embeddings and an untied output head share a second, single-slot pool. Peak VRAM
is therefore bounded by one decoder layer plus one vocabulary matrix rather than
the whole model. Only the LoRA adapters, their gradients and optimizer state
stay resident.

#: Families whose decoder layout has been proven bit-exact against a resident
#: run of the same numerics (v0.72.0 llama/qwen2/qwen3; v0.72.3 GATE 1 added the
#: rest, under bf16 AND NF4). An allowlist rather than a heuristic because a
#: half-supported architecture streams weights into the wrong module and
#: mis-trains silently instead of crashing.
#:
#: ``gemma3_text`` is present but ``gemma3`` is NOT: a real ``google/gemma-3-*``

#: The loss path's own arithmetic, in VRAM bytes per logit element. **Measured
#: stage by stage (issue #327), not derived.** ``ForCausalLMLoss`` upcasts to
#: fp32, hands the view to ``cross_entropy`` and returns; the residency at each
#: stage, per element, excluding the source logits tensor:
#:
#:   after the loss returns   4  — only log-softmax's saved fp32 output survives;
#:                                 the fp32 upcast is freed with the local
#:   backward peak           12  — that saved output plus the two transient fp32
#:                                 gradient buffers (nll -> log-softmax)
#:
#: So the peak holds THREE fp32 logits-shaped buffers, not "upcast + softmax +
#: grad" as v0.72.3 recorded — the totals agree, the decomposition did not.
#: Measured 12.000000 exactly, spread 0.00e+00 over 3 repeats, at every
#: (vocab, tokens) probed, and **byte-identical under torch 2.5.1 and 2.13.0
#: and under trl 0.19.1 and 0.26.2** — this term is not stack-dependent.
LOGITS_LOSS_BYTES_PER_ELEMENT = 12

#: One further bf16 logits-shaped tensor, charged unconditionally.
#:
#: This is the whole of the inter-stack disagreement in issue #327. The v0.72.3
#: grid (RTX 3050 / Windows) needs 13.869-13.901 bytes per element across its
#: ten rows; the H100 grid fits 12.311, and a real ``trl`` training step
#: measured on that box marginals at 12.0955 (12.0821 once the probe fixture's
#: own per-token cost is removed). The excess the RTX grid requires over that
#: is **1.8031 bytes per element**, fitted across its 3.1x vocab contrast with a
#: flat residual of 21.0 bytes per token — i.e. the excess is vocab-scaled, the
#: size of one bf16 copy of the logits, and not a mis-modelled activation term.
#: A single-variable control reproduces it directly: holding the model
#: output object across ``backward()`` instead of letting it die with the local
#: costs **+2.0000 bytes per element**, at 5 of 6 (vocab, tokens) cells and
#: +2.0480 at the sixth (allocator rounding on a 32k-vocab, 256-token cell).
#:
#: What retains it on that stack is NOT identified. torch, trl and transformers
#: were each swapped to the RTX grid's versions on the H100 box and the real
#: training step measured byte-identical, so none of them is the cause. Until
#: something can OBSERVE the retention at pre-flight — a synthetic probe cannot,
#: it sees only its own reference — this stays charged: dropping it under-
#: predicts 10 of the 10 v0.72.3 rows by up to 10.49%, and on Windows an
#: under-prediction does not raise, it silently spills to host memory.
LOGITS_RETENTION_BYTES_PER_ELEMENT = 2

#: VRAM bytes per logit element at peak: the loss arithmetic plus the retained
#: copy. v0.72.0 charged 6 from first principles, which under-predicts this term
#: by 2.33x — a ~5 GB error on a 152k-vocab model at batch 8, where the logits
#: tensor is 146x the entire buffer pool.
LOGITS_BYTES_PER_ELEMENT = LOGITS_LOSS_BYTES_PER_ELEMENT + LOGITS_RETENTION_BYTES_PER_ELEMENT
#: Forward only, no loss: just the bf16 logits.
LOGITS_BYTES_PER_ELEMENT_NO_LOSS = 2

#: Bytes per trainable adapter parameter at peak: fp32 weight + fp32 grad +
#: Adam ``m`` + ``v``. Charged even under an 8-bit optimizer (which needs 10) —
#: over-charging ~6 bytes across a few million adapter parameters is noise next
#: to the logits term, and it errs in the safe direction.
OPTIMIZER_BYTES_PER_PARAM = 16

#: Constant offset measured across both GATE 2 models (RoPE caches, allocator
#: rounding, small per-run buffers). It came out at ~13.3 MB for a 135M model
#: and a 0.5B model alike, so it is charged as a constant rather than scaled.
STREAM_FIXED_SLACK_BYTES = 13_500_000

#: Fraction of the *measured same-session GEMM ceiling* that real streamed
#: training actually reached on the dev box: 68% (Llama-3.1-8B NF4, 5.26 of
#: 7.74 TFLOPS) up to ~100% (small models, fully pinned store). A forecast
#: quoted as a single number would over-promise by up to 1.5x, so the bracket
#: travels with it.
MEASURED_CEILING_FRACTION = (0.68, 1.0)

    THE one formula, so the pre-flight, the panel and the RAM refusal cannot

    ``AsyncDiskSource`` allocates ``min(read_ahead, members) x group_bytes``
