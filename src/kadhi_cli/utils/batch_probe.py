"""OOM-binary-search auto batch size + cache (v0.36.0 Part D).

Replaces sft.py's static-formula auto batch (which under-counts activations,
gradient buffers, and optimizer state and is frequently wrong on first run)
with a real try/halve loop. Mirrors LlamaFactory + Axolotl probes.

The probe runs ONE forward+backward+step per candidate before the real
training loop. To avoid re-probing on every run, the picked size is cached
in a JSON file keyed on the (model, max_length, quantization, lora_r, gpu)
tuple. Default cache path: ``~/.kadhi/batch_cache.json``. Override via
``KADHI_BATCH_CACHE_PATH`` env var (used by tests).

Pure-logic surface (binary-search loop, cache I/O, key normalisation) is
fully testable without CUDA. The CUDA-side ``probe_fn`` callable is supplied
by the trainer wrapper at runtime.

    any of torch's spellings (:func:`_is_cuda_oom`) OR when it completes with
    a measured peak above what this process can reach on the device. Other
    exceptions propagate so misconfiguration surfaces.

    The second criterion is the #649 fix. Under WDDM (native Windows, WSL2)
    the allocator does not raise when dedicated VRAM runs out; it spills to
    host memory and the step completes an order of magnitude slower, so "did
    not throw" is not "fits". The gate reads ``max_memory_allocated`` after
    the step, deliberately not ``max_memory_reserved``: reserved runs
    1.08-1.41x allocated and gating on it refuses configurations that run
    (measured for :func:`~kadhi_cli.utils.layer_stream.decide_measured_fit`,
    which this mirrors). The threshold is the budget from
    :func:`_probe_budget_bytes`, not a fraction of it: the probe's peak
    already runs above the real step (12.5-14.3% in the streaming
    measurements), which is the direction that makes an exact comparison
    safe.

    Returns ``None`` on non-CUDA devices, when torch is unavailable, when
    ``cuda.is_available()`` is False, or when any of the inputs is missing
    — :func:`pick_batch_size` falls back to the static estimate via its
