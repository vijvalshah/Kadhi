"""training.stream_layers — streaming runtime (v0.72.0 BETA).

The torch half: pre-allocated VRAM buffer pool, the CPU-RAM weight source, the
prefetch scheduler, the layer wrapper, and the meta-device model build.

Data flow per step (plan 5.2)::

    FORWARD   layer i: wait(i) -> prefetch(i+1) -> checkpoint(body_i)
    BACKWARD  layer i: wait(i) -> prefetch(i-1) -> recompute + backward

Each layer is read TWICE per step and that cannot be optimised away:
``dL/dx = W^T . dL/dy``, so the backward pass needs W to reach lower layers and
their adapters. This is physics, not an implementation detail.

**No top-level torch / peft / transformers** — all lazy, so the light CLI keeps
importing without the training stack.

        ctx.state = quant_state
        ctx.tensors = (None, B)

    ``torch.utils.checkpoint`` discards and recomputes *saved tensors*. These are
    not saved tensors, so it cannot see them: the reference taken in the forward
    survives, it ALIASES the buffer pool, and the backward reads it after that slot
    has been refilled with a different layer. Measured on 8xH100 against a resident
    NF4 reference, that is a bit-exact forward, a healthy-looking loss curve, and
    gradients wrong on every layer but the last ``stream_buffers``.

    De-aliasing was measured and rejected: bnb holds the reference across the whole
    forward-to-backward span, so any copy keeps one layer alive for that span and
    costs O(model). On real 32B, peak VRAM 4 220 -> 19 720 MiB.

    So the weight never enters that autograd Function. It is dequantised inside the
    checkpointed region and multiplied natively; ``F.linear`` saves the dequantised
    tensor through the ordinary mechanism, which checkpointing DOES discard and
    recompute, and the transient lives only inside the recomputed block — O(window).

    This changes the computation path used by the patched NF4 module. With
    bitsandbytes 0.50.2, the native fused ``MatMul4Bit`` path and explicit
    ``dequantize_4bit`` + ``F.linear`` can differ depending on the CUDA
    architecture and projection shape. The dequantise + linear path is retained
    for correctness under checkpointing (#331); this path choice is not assumed
    to be numerically free.

    """Run one forward+backward at the configured shape and read the real peak.

    This is the #349 instrument. The pre-flight's formula is fitted and, measured
    against the real training run, under-predicts past seq 4352 (0.934x the real
    peak at seq 5120, 0.787x at 6144); against this probe the same formula reads
    0.992x at seq 4096 and 0.830x at 5120, because the probe runs 12.5-14.3%
    above the real training step — conservatively high, the direction that makes
    it safe as a gate. A formula cannot model a term nobody has identified, so
    past that point only a measurement is honest. Synthetic
    ``input_ids`` are used rather than a real batch because the quantity being
    bounded is the CONFIGURED shape, which is the worst case any real batch can
    pad up to; a real batch would measure whatever length it happened to have.
    Validated against a full ``kadhi train`` run of the same config: probe
    4.3117 GB reserved vs the real run's 4.3159 GB, 0.1% apart.

    Costs one step. Measured on an RTX 3050 Laptop: 1.02-1.15 s for
    SmolLM2-135M at 1x1024, 5.09 s at 2x2048, and 5.33 s for Llama-3.1-8B NF4 at
    1x512 — against a training run of minutes to hours.

    Returns ``None`` off CUDA or when the probe itself breaks, rather than
    raising: a pre-flight that dies because its own instrument failed is worse
    than one that falls back to the shipped prediction. That is the same contract
    :func:`~kadhi_cli.utils.layer_stream.measure_logits_loss_bytes_per_element`
    already keeps.

    On the RAM tier, page-locking is bounded by the box rather than by free RAM

    a pageable store is correct; hiding the ~97% -> ~79% GPU-utilisation cost is
    not, so the fallback says so out loud.

    ``require_pin`` (from ``training.stream_pin=true``) turns that fallback into
    a hard refusal on the RAM tier: the user asked for the pinned store
    explicitly, so silently degrading to a pageable one — spending the whole
    throughput margin pinning exists to provide — is exactly the outcome the flag
    exists to prevent.

    The DISK tier now behaves the same way, for the same reason. It used to
    *announce* that pinning was inapplicable — true while the base streamed from
    NVMe into a freshly allocated tensor per call, with nothing to page-lock.
    ``AsyncDiskSource`` reads ahead into reusable HOST STAGING (#971), and that
    staging is exactly the kind of memory pinning exists for: out of pageable
    memory the host-to-device copy is synchronous and the reader cannot overlap
    with compute. So an explicit ``training.stream_pin`` is honoured or refused
    here, never explained away.

    ``read_ahead`` (``training.stream_read_ahead``) is the reader's depth and
    therefore the multiplier on how much host memory is page-locked, which makes
    lowering it a remedy the RAM tier cannot offer.

    The second element of the returned tuple means the same thing on both tiers:
