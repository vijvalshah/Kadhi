"""Parse a safetensors header without mapping the file.

``safe_open`` memory-maps, and on Windows a mapping charges commit for the
file's whole size (#926, measured: 48.99 GB mapped raised the commit charge
46.17 GB). The streaming disk tier holds one shard per decoder layer for a
whole run, so mapping is what we are avoiding, not an implementation detail.

The format is: 8 bytes little-endian header length, that many bytes of JSON
mapping name -> {dtype, shape, data_offsets}, then the tensor bytes. Offsets in
the JSON are relative to the end of the header; ``TensorRange`` stores them
ABSOLUTE so a caller can seek directly.

NO top-level torch or safetensors: this module is import-light by design.
