"""MultipackBatchSampler — First-Fit-Decreasing bin packing for SFT/pretrain.

Ports Axolotl's ``MultipackBatchSampler`` (utils/samplers/multipack.py:24-57)
without the numba runtime dependency. The pure-Python FFD here is fast enough
for typical dataset sizes (<1M samples); a future ``[multipack]`` extras can
add an optional numba JIT path keyed off the same ``ffd_bin_pack`` signature.

Compared with Axolotl, two intentional differences:

1. **Loud-fail on unknown architecture.** Axolotl's monkey-patch silently
   misses architectures absent from its allowlist
   (`monkeypatch/multipack.py:13-66`). Kadhi raises ``ValueError`` so the user
   knows multipack is not active. Mirrors the v0.33.0 #43 schema-gate policy.
2. **bool rejection on numeric inputs.** Mirrors v0.30.0 ``Candidate``
   policy — bool is a subclass of int and must not silently coerce.
