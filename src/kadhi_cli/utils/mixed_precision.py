"""Auto mixed-precision picker (v0.32.0 Part C).

Maps a model + GPU compute capability to the best mixed-precision setting:
``bf16`` (Ampere+, most modern models), ``fp16`` (Turing or known
fp16-stable models), or ``no`` (Pascal and older).

Quirk map is keyed on a lower-cased substring of the model id so we catch
both ``Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct`` and ``alibaba/Qwen2.5-3B`` with one entry.
