"""Tier 2, asynchronous: the base stays on NVMe and a background thread reads it.

The shipped ``DiskSource`` calls ``safe_open(...).get_tensor`` from
``LayerBufferPool.load_async``, which is only "async" about the copy to the GPU:
the read happens on the COMPUTE thread before the copy is enqueued, so the
Python thread blocks, the GPU starves, and the starvation shows up as wall time
rather than as a stall. Measured cold on a 36 GB 70B-shaped store: 0.57 GB/s
average and 22 MB/s at worst, from a drive that reads 3.5+ GB/s.

This source reads ahead on its own thread into pre-allocated pinned host
buffers, so ``get`` is a handoff. It never memory-maps: a mapping charges
Windows commit for the file's whole size (#926), and holding one per decoder
layer costs ~35 GB of charge for a 70B run.

``get(idx, name)`` keeps the interface ``RamSource`` and ``DiskSource`` share,
so the prefetcher and the layer wrapper are untouched and the v0.72.0
correctness gates carry over rather than being re-derived. ONE call is added
rather than kept: ``release(idx, event)``. A reusable staging buffer is exactly
what the other two sources do not have — ``RamSource`` holds every layer for the
whole run and ``DiskSource`` returns a freshly allocated tensor per call, so
neither can be recycled underneath an in-flight copy. This source can, and out
of PINNED host memory ``dst.copy_(..., non_blocking=True)`` is still draining
when ``load_async`` returns while ``pool.wait`` is a GPU-side ``wait_event``
that does not block the Python thread at all. Measured through the real pool
before ``release`` existed: 7 of 8 layers reached the device holding another
layer's weights at ``read_ahead=1``, 6 of 8 at the default 2, 4 of 8 at 4.

One layer spec group is assumed to occupy a CONTIGUOUS run of indices, which
is what ``_build_source`` produces: the decoder layers in order, then the
vocabulary-sized shards one group each. ``_group_bounds`` takes a group's span
from its lowest and highest index, so on a synthetic index whose groups
alternate the span is wider than the membership and the effective lookahead
window halves. That costs depth, never correctness — no wedge, no wrong bytes.

          there.

          reachable wedge: a reader blocked inside ``read_into`` (a stalled

          queued, so no amount of state-inspection can tell it from a slow

          time the consumer spends unable to proceed, and charging the wider

        draining when the call returns, and ``pool.wait`` is a GPU-side
        ``wait_event`` that never blocks the Python thread. Recycling the
        staging buffer at that point rewrites the bytes the copy is reading:
        measured through the real pool, 6 of 8 layers reached the device holding
        another layer's weights at the default depth.

        on it before reusing the slot. ``None`` means the copy was already
        synchronous (no side stream, or a non-CUDA device) and the slot is free
        immediately. A layer that is no longer resident is ignored: it can only
        have been evicted, which requires having been released already.
