    An ``"auto"`` load of a bf16-saved checkpoint would then leave the
    resident weights in bf16 storage while every other tensor on the card is
    float16, the same storage/compute split v0.73.1 (#385/#387) removed from
    the other bf16-hardcoded call sites. Returning ``torch.float16`` there
    keeps storage and compute in the same dtype. On CPU this still returns
    ``"auto"``: the VRAM-saving reason for keeping the checkpoint's own dtype
    does not apply there, but CPU use in this codebase is smoke tests only,
    so a bf16-saved checkpoint loading bf16 on CPU is harmless in practice.
