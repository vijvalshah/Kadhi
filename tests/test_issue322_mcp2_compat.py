"""Issue #322 — `kadhi mcp serve` on both mcp 1.x and 2.x.

mcp 2.0.0 removed two things Kadhi was built on: the
``@server.list_tools()`` / ``@server.call_tool()`` decorators, and
``mcp.shared.memory.create_connected_server_and_client_session``. v0.72.3
capped the extra at ``<2`` to unblock a release, which pinned anyone who wanted
2.x in the same environment.

The bridge is a **capability probe**, not a version comparison. That choice is
not stylistic: this repository has twice derived a bound by reading source or a
version table and been wrong both times — see ``trainer/_trl_compat.py``, whose
module docstring records the rule it earned. A probe cannot go stale, because it
asks the object in front of it.

The round-trip behaviour itself is asserted by ``test_v07128.py``'s
``TestServerRoundTrip``, which now runs unchanged on either major. What is
pinned here is the machinery that lets it: the probe, the shared helpers, and
the fact that neither is a version check in disguise.
