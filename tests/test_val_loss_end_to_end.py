"""Validation loss must reach the sinks — on BOTH backends (#23 follow-up).

Found while bridging MLX's `on_val_loss_report`, but it is not an MLX gap.
`KadhiTrainerCallback.on_log` reads `logs["loss"]` and never `logs["eval_loss"]`,
so an evaluation step leaves `_last_loss` untouched and **re-reports the stale
training number to every sink at the same step**. The evaluated value has never
existed anywhere in this project:

* `TrainingDisplay.update()` reads only `grad_norm`, `speed`, `gpu_mem` from
  ``**kwargs`` and drops the rest;
* the ``metrics`` table has no column for it;
* ``TrainEvent`` has no field for it.

So wiring a producer alone would have shipped a value that three sinks discard —
the collected-and-read-by-nothing shape this repo has already found in #363 and
#659. The sinks come first here, which is why this file starts with the schema.

The migration is the part that can hurt people: ``~/.kadhi/experiments.db``
exists on every machine that has ever run ``kadhi train``, so an ``ALTER TABLE``
that assumes a fresh schema would crash the CLI for every existing user.
