"""The declared torch floor must be the binding one, and doctor's copy pinned (#636).

``pyproject.toml [train]`` declared ``torch>=2.6.0`` while requiring
``transformers>=5.16.1``. The torch floor is kept explicit because TRL's
FSDP2-based preference trainers require the public PyTorch 2.6 API, and
``kadhi doctor`` carries a second literal copy that must not drift.
These tests pin both halves:

* the pyproject floor is at least what the *declared* transformers floor's own
  torch extra requires. That requirement is read from real metadata only where
  the installed transformers is exactly the declared floor — the
  ``transformers-floor`` CI job installs precisely that release under
  ``.github/constraints/transformers-floor.txt``. Anywhere else the check skips
  with a reason instead of passing vacuously against whatever transformers
  happens to be installed (an older one forces a lower floor, a newer one could
  turn the repo red without any repo change).
* the constraints file pins the declared transformers floor, so the metadata
  check above can never silently validate a different release than the one
  ``[train]`` declares.
* doctor's torch literal equals the pyproject declaration — hermetic, repo text
  against src literal, the pin that keeps the second copy honest.

pyproject is parsed with regex rather than ``tomllib`` because ``tomllib`` is
3.11+ and this repo supports 3.10 — the same convention as
``tests/test_requires_python_bound.py``.
