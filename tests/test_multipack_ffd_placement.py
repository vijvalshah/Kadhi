"""`ffd_bin_pack` places items through an indexed structure, not a scan (#694).

The packing is unchanged: same bins, same order, same exceptions. Only the cost
of finding each bin changed, from O(N) per item to O(log N). These tests exist
to keep that "unchanged" honest, because a first-fit implementation that
quietly becomes best-fit still produces plausible-looking bins.

The reference implementation below is the exact pre-#694 loop. Comparing
against it rather than against hand-written expectations is what makes the
equivalence claim checkable: a hand-written case pins what someone believed
the old code did, and the whole risk here is that the belief is wrong.
