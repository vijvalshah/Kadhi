"""Unknown config keys must not be silently dropped (#627).

None of the 9 config models set ``extra="forbid"``, so Pydantic's default
``extra="ignore"`` applied everywhere: a misspelled or not-yet-released key
validated clean, printed "Config valid. Ready to train!" under
``kadhi train --dry-run``, and was discarded.

The keys that reach users are not exotic. ``quantizaton``,
``gradient_checkpoint``, ``lr_scheduler`` and ``max_len`` are each one edit from
a real field, so the run keeps the default quantization / does no checkpointing
/ uses the default schedule while the operator believes otherwise. Exit 0,
plausible logs, and the requested thing silently not done.

#623 is the live example: ``training.stream_pin`` landed on main two days after
0.73.3 shipped, a user on the released wheel wrote the documented escape hatch,
``--dry-run`` called it valid, the key was dropped, and the resulting OOM was
diagnosed as a layer-streaming bug across two long comments.

Every test here is CPU-only: no GPU, no downloads, no model load.
