"""#621 / #638 — pin every recipe's *resolved* config, not its YAML source
text, without storing the same ~296 schema defaults 162 times over.

162 recipes across the catalog declare training fields that happen to equal
the schema default (``dpo_beta: 0.1``, etc.). Deleting one of those lines is
an equivalent mutation — the resolved ``KadhiConfig`` is byte-identical either
way — so no test should be built to kill it, and none here is (#621).

The real exposure is the other direction: nothing pins what a recipe
*resolves to*, so a schema-default change silently retunes every recipe that
relies on that default, with no red test anywhere. #621's original fixture
pinned this by storing each recipe's full resolved config — but that meant
162 copies of the same ~296 defaults (49,586 lines, 1.55 MB), and a single
schema-default change reddened all 149-odd recipes that didn't override it,
identically to how an *added* field reddened all 162 — the same wall of red
for two different classes of change (#638).

This fixture now stores the shared defaults ONCE, as ``baseline`` — a
minimal resolved config (placeholder base/task/data, everything else at
schema default) — and per recipe only the fields that differ from it
(``recipes``). Two consequences:

- A schema-default change (or an added field) moves the ONE committed
  baseline value. ``TestBaselineMatchesTheLiveSchema`` is the only place
  that shows up — not once per recipe that stays silent on the field.
- Per-recipe tests compare each recipe's delta *against the live baseline*,
  not the committed one, so they stay silent for every recipe that doesn't
  touch the changed field. What they do NOT erase: a recipe that redundantly
  pins a value equal to the OLD default starts appearing in its own delta
  once the default moves out from under it, because what used to be a no-op
  pin just started doing something — the recipe's resolved config hasn't
  changed, only its relationship to the (now different) baseline has. This
  is not a small edge case in general: for a rarely-pinned field
  (``dpo_beta``) it's ~13 recipes. For ``epochs`` — all 162 recipes declare
  it explicitly, distributed ``{1: 32, 2: 4, 3: 126}`` — moving the default
  3 -> 1 reddens 158: the 126 that pinned the old default plus the 32 that
  already pinned the new one, both now differing from a baseline that used
  to match one of them. The 4 pinning ``2`` stay green correctly, since
  neither the old nor the new default was ever their value. 158 named
  recipe tests plus the baseline — a wall of red on a change that alters
  no recipe's actual behavior. Measured, not
  estimated; see ``TestEveryRecipeMatchesItsCommittedDelta``. Traded
  deliberately for the property that matters more (a recipe that does NOT
  touch the field stays silent), but the size of the trade is real and
  belongs in the record rather than in the flattering example.

Regenerate the fixture with ``python scripts/generate_recipe_snapshot.py``
after a deliberate change — never automatically. The comparison is between
parsed Python objects (``json.load`` output vs. ``model_dump()``), not raw
file bytes, so it isn't sensitive to the CRLF/LF drift a byte-exact fixture
would be on a Windows checkout (the failure mode #580's review hit).
