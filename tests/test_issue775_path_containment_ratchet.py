"""#775 — repo-wide ratchet: containment must not ride on ``relative_to``.

``Path.resolve() + relative_to()`` is the containment idiom AGENTS.md bans:
one of the two paths can carry a Windows 8.3 short name (``C:\\Users\\RUNNER~1``)
while the other carries the long form, so ``relative_to`` raises ``ValueError``
for a path that *is* inside the base and the guard denies a legitimate write.
The migration to ``utils.paths.is_under`` (realpath + commonpath) is done; this
file is the lock that keeps it done.

**Why the previous guard was not a lock.** ``test_code_review_recurring.py``
asserted ``".relative_to(cwd)" not in src`` over **seven named files**. Two
holes, both fatal to its purpose:

1. *Scope.* A new module — or an eighth existing one — could reintroduce the
   idiom and the guard would never look at it.
2. *Spelling.* It matched one literal. ``.relative_to(base)``,
   ``.relative_to(root)``, ``.relative_to(\n    directory\n)`` and
   ``.is_relative_to(...)`` all sailed past. The variable happened to be named
   ``cwd`` at the sites that were migrated; nothing makes the next one agree.

So the scan is an AST walk over ``src/kadhi_cli/**/*.py`` and keys on the CALL,
not on the text around it. Every spelling of the receiver and the argument is
the same tree.

**What counts as containment** (a plain ``relative_to`` is not automatically a
bug — it is also the normal way to shorten a path for display):

* ``is_relative_to`` — always. It returns a bool and exists for no other
  purpose than answering "is this inside that".
* ``relative_to`` inside a ``try`` whose ``except`` can catch ``ValueError`` —
  that handler is the containment decision. Where the answer is used (deny,
  skip, fall back) is deliberately NOT inspected: telling "reject" from
  "cosmetic fallback" apart needs a taint analysis, and the cheap version got
  ``adapters.py:38`` wrong in both directions while being written. A benign
  site is one allowlist line with a reason instead.
  ``with contextlib.suppress(ValueError):`` is the same decision written as a
  context manager and counts identically.
* ``relative_to`` in a boolean position — ``if``/``while``/``assert`` test,
  ``not``, ``and``/``or``, a ternary condition, a comprehension filter. Nobody
  writes that for display.

Everything else — ``rel = p.relative_to(root)`` with no ``ValueError`` guard —
is left alone.

At the time of writing the scan finds **two** sites, both in
``commands/adapters.py``, both benign and both allowlisted below with their
reason. There is no cleanup left, which makes ``TestTheScannerCanActuallyFail``
load-bearing: a scanner whose only findings are allowlisted must be shown
capable of finding something, or it is indistinguishable from one that matches
nothing at all.
