"""Issue #323 — every keyword a trainer passes to a trl config must exist.

The drift this guards is documented in #323 and its comment: the ``[train]``
extra pinned ``trl>=0.7.0`` with no upper bound, CI resolved 0.29.1 while the
dev box ran 0.19.1, and on 0.29.1 six trainers could not build their config at
all. **CI stayed green through all of it**, because the ``trl`` imports live
inside ``setup()`` and no test had ever called it -- the wrappers were only ever
instantiated. As the issue's comment puts it:

    an unbounded floor-only pin plus a test that never reaches the import is
    indistinguishable from working software.

Calling ``setup()`` needs a model and a dataset. This asks the same question
without either: read the keywords each wrapper passes to its trl config, and ask
the class *as installed* whether it still accepts them. The probe is
``_trl_compat.config_accepts``, which the wrappers already use at runtime -- a
capability question, never a version comparison, because a version table is
what was wrong twice.

**Known blind spot, stated rather than implied:** ``**splat`` arguments are
invisible to a static read. ``grpo.py`` builds ``GRPOConfig(**grpo_kwargs)`` and
``sft.py`` builds ``SFTConfig(**dict_args)``, so their keywords are not checked
here. What is checked is every keyword written literally at the call site --
which is where ``max_prompt_length`` lived before #326 moved it behind a helper.

The trl TRAINER classes are out of scope for the same reason inverted: they take
much of their signature through ``**kwargs``, so a static signature check
reports ``model`` and ``train_dataset`` as rejected. Measured, not assumed --
that false alarm is why the alias branch below filters on ``Config``.
