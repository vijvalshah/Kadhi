"""The SGLang backend must obey the v0.36.0 trust_remote_code gate.

``serve.py`` resolves ``--trust-remote-code`` **once for every backend** and its
own comment states the intent: "so no backend silently executes an untrusted
repo's code". vLLM receives that resolved value. SGLang did not: it was called
without the argument at all, and ``create_sglang_runtime`` hardcoded
``trust_remote_code=True`` at both of its ``sgl.Runtime`` call sites.

The result is that on ``kadhi serve --backend sglang`` the default-deny gate did
not apply. A user who never passed ``--trust-remote-code`` still had a model's
custom repo code executed, which is the exact behaviour v0.36.0 removed from the
vLLM path.

The panel printed above the load said so honestly -- "SGLang loads models with
trust_remote_code enabled" -- but a notice is not a gate, and it told the user
what was happening rather than letting them decide.

Each surface is pinned independently: the runtime's non-adapter call site, its
adapter call site, and the tokenizer load. A fix that threads the flag through
one and forgets another must fail here rather than pass.
