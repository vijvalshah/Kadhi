"""Regression tests for issue #695.

`kadhi data validate` used to disagree with `load_dataset`: `validate_and_stats`
validated a row by top-level key presence (`FORMAT_SIGNATURES`), while the loader
runs `format_to_messages` and drops any row that returns `None`. Those are two
different notions of "valid", so they drifted apart in two ways:

1. Six formats are absent from `FORMAT_SIGNATURES` (`prm`, `pre_tokenized`,
   `input_output`, `video`, `multimodal`, `raft`), so validation was skipped
   entirely and every row was reported valid regardless of content.
2. For the formats that were checked, key presence passed rows the converter
   drops on a value (a null field, a non-dict message, ...).

The fix computes `valid_rows` by running the real conversion path per row, so
agreement is structural. These tests pin that: they assert `validate` and
`load_dataset` agree on a *specific count*, not merely that some rows are
flagged — a validator wrong in the other direction would pass the weaker form.
