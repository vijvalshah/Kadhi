"""#764 — a failure during setup left the tracker row at status='running' forever.

`kadhi train` registers a run in the experiment tracker before it loads the
model, and the only `except` that marked a run failed covered the training
call alone. Everything in between -- tokenizer load, model load,
quantization, LoRA attach, dataset mapping, trainer construction -- left the
row unreconcilable: on a real database, 220 of 432 runs were stuck at
'running', the oldest since 2026-03-04.

Two independent parts, both covered here:
1. The failure boundary now wraps from right after the run is registered
   through the end of the command, so any setup exception reaches
   ``fail_run`` with the exception type and message recorded.
2. ``kadhi train`` now records its own pid via ``mark_running`` the way the
   MCP execution path already does, so ``_reconcile_orphaned_run`` (#401)
   can rescue a SIGKILL'd or Ctrl+C'd run on the next `kadhi runs` the same
   way it already does for MCP-spawned runs.
