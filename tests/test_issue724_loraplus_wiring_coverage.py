"""Issue #724 — the LoRA+ optimizer wiring, in every wrapper that should have it.

#724 fixed the failure in ``trainer/sft.py``, ``pretrain.py`` and ``embedding.py``:
``loraplus_lr_ratio`` was forwarded into ``TrainingArguments``, which is not a
field there, so the run crashed before the first step. The fix routes it through
``attach_loraplus_optimizer`` instead, called after the trainer is built.

That change made the failure mode *quieter*, which is exactly why it needs this
scan. Before #724 a wrapper that never wired LoRA+ **crashed** on the unknown
keyword; after #724 a wrapper that never calls ``attach_loraplus_optimizer`` runs
to completion with LoRA+ silently disabled — the loss curve looks normal and the
B matrices simply trained at the base rate. A test has to provide the signal the
crash used to give for free.

Coverage is derived by SCANNING ``kadhi_cli/trainer/`` (following
``tests/test_issue359_deepspeed_guard_coverage.py``) rather than a hand-written
list, so a wrapper added later cannot ship LoRA+-less without either wiring it or
being named — with a reason — in the exemption set below.

Finding this scan surfaced, recorded here so it is not lost: LoRA+ is a shared
``TrainingConfig`` option with no task gating, but only the three SFT-family
wrappers ever implemented it. The other PEFT-building wrappers (preference/RL/
specialised trainers) accept ``loraplus_lr_ratio`` and silently ignore it — they
build no custom optimizer at all. Extending LoRA+ to them, or rejecting it there,
is out of #724's scope (the three that crashed) and belongs in a follow-up; until
then they are listed in ``_LORAPLUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`` so the gap is explicit.
