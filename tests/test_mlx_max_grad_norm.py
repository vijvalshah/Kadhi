"""`training.max_grad_norm` is dropped on the MLX backend.

The field is declared `max_grad_norm: float = Field(default=1.0, gt=0)`
(`config/schema.py:1098`) and forwarded into `TrainingArguments` by sixteen
transformers trainers, so the documented default clips every transformers run
at 1.0. On `backend: mlx` it reaches nothing:

* no MLX trainer file mentions it, and
* `mlx_lm 0.31.3`'s `TrainingArgs` has no such field and its `trainer.py`
  contains no `clip`/`norm` call at all, so upstream never clips either, and
* `_check_unsupported()` does not list it, so nothing is printed.

The same config therefore trains with clipping on transformers and without it
on MLX, silently. Measured on an M1 with the real library, one SGD step on a
deliberately ill-conditioned batch:

    no clipping (today's MLX)      |w - w0| = 388.025909
    clip_grad_norm(max_norm=1.0)   |w - w0| =   0.008490
    clip_grad_norm(max_norm=0.01)  |w - w0| =   0.000085

`mlx.optimizers.clip_grad_norm(grads, max_norm)` exists, and mlx-lm applies
gradients through exactly one call -- `optimizer.update(model, grad)` at
`trainer.py:259` -- so clipping is reachable by handing `train()` an optimizer
that clips before delegating, without forking upstream's loop. That call site
sits inside a function compiled with
`@partial(mx.compile, inputs=state, outputs=state)` (`trainer.py:246-248`), and
the measurements above were taken through that same compiled shape, so the
proxy is known to survive tracing rather than assumed to.

Worth stating because it bounds the impact: AdamW normalises by its second
moment, so clipping changes an AdamW step far less than an SGD one. Under the
same probe with AdamW the movement was 4.848 unclipped and 4.852 clipped. The
runs this actually rescues are `optimizer: sgd` / `lion`, and any run whose
gradients spike.
