"""Tests for Issue #686: MLX SFT ignores warmup, scheduler and weight decay.

The MLX backend built `optim.AdamW(learning_rate=<scalar>)` and nothing else,
so `warmup_ratio`, `scheduler`, `weight_decay` and `optimizer` were validated,
accepted and dropped without a warning.

The load-bearing fact is the step unit. MLX calls a callable `learning_rate`
with `optimizer.step`, which advances once per `optimizer.update()`, and mlx-lm
calls that only every `grad_accumulation_steps` iterations -- so the schedule
counts optimizer UPDATES. A schedule built against `iters` would stretch its
warmup by that factor and never reach the cosine floor, while still producing a
perfectly plausible-looking curve. `TestTheStepUnitIsOptimizerUpdates` is the
reason this file exists.
