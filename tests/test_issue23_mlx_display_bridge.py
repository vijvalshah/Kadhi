"""#23 acceptance item 4 — the Rich callback bridge on the MLX path.

``MLXSFTTrainerWrapper.train()`` accepted ``display`` / ``tracker`` / ``run_id``
and opened with ``del display, tracker, run_id  # accepted for CLI-contract
parity``, so an MLX run showed mlx-lm's raw stdout while the identical config on
the transformers path got Kadhi's live dashboard.

This is an **adapter**, not a subclass, and the tests are written that way on
purpose: ``KadhiTrainerCallback`` is a HuggingFace ``TrainerCallback`` that wants
``args, state, control``, while mlx-lm offers only
``on_train_loss_report(train_info)`` / ``on_val_loss_report(val_info)``.
Manufacturing fake HF state to reuse it would couple the MLX path to HF trainer
internals; the bridge drives ``TrainingDisplay`` directly instead.

Everything here runs the real ``train()`` body against the fake ``mlx`` /
``mlx_lm`` modules from ``test_issue634_mlx_resume`` — real control flow and
real call ordering, not source-text inspection. What that cannot cover, stated
rather than implied: real mlx-lm emitting these dicts at real cadence. That half
was checked by hand on an 8 GB M1 (see ``benchmarks/run-m1-8gb-mlx-sft.md``).
