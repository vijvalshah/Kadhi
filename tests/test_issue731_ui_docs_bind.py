"""Tests for Issue #731: FastAPI docs routes on a non-loopback `kadhi ui` bind.

`kadhi ui --public` serves `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, `/docs/oauth2-redirect` and
`/redoc` without a token, so anyone on the LAN can enumerate every route,
parameter and schema. No values leak -- every endpoint the schema describes
answers 401 -- so this is reconnaissance rather than disclosure, which is why
the fix removes the routes on a non-loopback bind rather than gating them.

Gating was rejected deliberately: `/docs` is a browser navigation and Swagger
cannot attach a Bearer header to it, so `Depends(_verify_token)` would make the
page unusable for the developer while `/openapi.json` stayed reachable to
anything that speaks curl. Removing the routes (`openapi_url=None`) leaves no
handler to reach at all, and costs the loopback developer nothing.

    `:1149` is the same for `redoc_url`, and `:1139` (oauth2-redirect) is nested
    inside the `/docs` block. So `openapi_url=None` alone already removes all
    four, and a mutation that re-enables only `docs_url` or `redoc_url` changes
    no behaviour today.

    That makes the other three parameters defence-in-depth against a future edit
    that restores the schema route -- which is a real risk, because the schema is
    the one a developer is most likely to want back. These tests pin the upstream
    contract those parameters depend on, so if FastAPI ever registers `/docs`
    without a schema URL, we find out here rather than on a LAN bind.
