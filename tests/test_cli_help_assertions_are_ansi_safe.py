"""Repo-wide ratchet: a `--help` assertion must never read RAW CLI output.

This failure has turned CI red **four times** — v0.71.26, v0.71.32, v0.71.35 and
v0.73.2, the last one on all nine test cells at once. Each time it was written
down (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING, a memory note) and each time it happened again,
which is the argument for a check that FAILS rather than another paragraph that
asks people to remember.

**The mechanism, precisely.** Typer renders `--help` through a Rich table and
styles each option name, so on a colour-capable stream Rich emits escapes
*inside* the flag::

    --noise-floor  ->  -\\x1b[0m\\x1b[1;36m-noise\\x1b[0m\\x1b[1;36m-floor

`"--noise-floor" in result.output` then cannot match. **Windows passes**, because
Rich auto-disables colour there — so a green local run on a Windows box proves
nothing about the Linux/macOS cells. That asymmetry is the entire trap.

**Scope is deliberately narrow: `--help` output only.** A flag named inside an
ERROR message is fine and is NOT flagged, because `console.print(f"... --model
...")` interpolates plain text that Rich does not style per-token. Measured
before writing this guard: 13 such error-message assertions exist across 10
files and all of them are correct. Flagging those would make this test noise,
and a noisy guard gets deleted.

At the time of writing this scanner finds **zero** offenders — it is a ratchet,
not a cleanup. `TestTheScannerCanActuallyFail` is therefore load-bearing: a
scanner that has nothing to find must still be shown capable of finding
something, or it is indistinguishable from one that is silently broken.
