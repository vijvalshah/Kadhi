"""``kadhi sweep --dry-run`` must validate, not just print the grid (#642).

The dry-run branch returned before the config was ever loaded, so neither the
loader's unknown-key warning (#627) nor the sweep-parameter pre-flight (#628)
was reachable under it — the headline complaint of #627 (a dry run printing a
clean bill over a typo'd key) was fixed for ``train`` in #628 and left standing
here. ``--dry-run`` now means "validate, then print the grid without running
anything".

Every test runs the real command through the CLI runner and asserts on its
output and exit code — no source-text assertions, per the #628 review note
(that pattern passed three times while the caller was unwired). CPU-only: no
downloads, no model load, no training.
