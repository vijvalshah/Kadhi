"""Syntax-highlighted CLI output must be normalised before it is read (#633).

``kadhi recipes show`` and ``kadhi data mix --apply`` render YAML through Rich
with Pygments highlighting. With colour enabled, escape sequences land *between
the tokens of one logical line* -- ``modality`` / ``:`` / ``text`` are three
tokens, so ``"modality: text"`` is not a substring of the rendered output, and
``yaml.safe_load`` rejects ``\\x1b`` outright.

CI never sees this: GitHub runners have no TTY and do not set ``FORCE_COLOR``,
so Rich disables colour. It appears only for a contributor whose terminal forces
colour, as three red tests on a clean checkout with no local changes.

This is the failure mode ``test_cli_help_assertions_are_ansi_safe.py`` was
written for after it "turned CI red everywhere else (it has, four times)". That
guard only ever looks at functions containing ``--help``, so no other subcommand
was covered.

Note what does *not* break: a bare model id such as ``Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B`` is a
single Pygments token, so no escape lands inside it. The distinction is between
single-token and multi-token assertions, which is why this went unnoticed while
neighbouring assertions in the same files kept passing.
