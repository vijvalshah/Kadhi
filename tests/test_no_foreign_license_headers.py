"""No tracked file may carry a third-party licence header (repo-wide ratchet).

at the top -- twice in ``8e4f012`` (removed by hand) and a third time in
``3426f2c``, which **I merged without noticing**, having already been burned by
it once that same day. The cause is now known and was disclosed by a
contributor: automated tooling that carries file templates between projects
carries their licence headers with them.

So this is a check rather than another paragraph in CONTRIBUTING.md. The
project's own record on that is unambiguous -- the Rich/ANSI ``--help`` failure
was written into CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING and a memory note after each of four
occurrences and recurred every time, until
``test_cli_help_assertions_are_ansi_safe.py`` made it fail. Prose has been
tried here and it demonstrably does not hold.

Why the licence half matters more than the tidiness half: an AGPL header on a
file in an Apache-2.0 distribution is a licensing claim about that file. It
does not become true by being wrong, but a downstream redistributor reading it
has to act as though it might be, and we ship to PyPI.

**Scope is deliberately the header region and comment lines only.** Body
mentions of copyleft licence names are legitimate and must not be flagged:
``utils/license_advisor.py`` and ``utils/license_matrix.py`` exist precisely to
reason about AGPL/GPL compatibility, and a scanner that fires on them would be
deleted within a week -- which is the failure mode of a guard that cries wolf.
``TestTheScannerCanActuallyFail`` is load-bearing for the opposite reason: this
scanner finds zero offenders once the repo is clean, and a scanner with nothing
to find is indistinguishable from one that is silently broken.

    verbatim quotation of the header it exists to catch -- and turned all nine

    from ``git ls-files`` and the scanner therefore never read itself.

    Requiring column 0 costs nothing real: every occurrence of the header this
    guard was written for sat at column 0, which is where tooling emits a file
