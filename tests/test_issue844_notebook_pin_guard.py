"""Guard for Issue #844: `notebooks/proof-4gb.ipynb` going stale again.

The notebook was found installing from `git+...@main` while its prose called an
older release "published" and cited a closed issue as open -- because nothing
checked the pin against reality. This test reads the notebook JSON directly (no
kernel, no network, no GPU) and asserts the three things that made it stale:

- the install cell pins an exact `kadhi-cli[train]==X.Y.Z`, never a `git+` URL;
- that `X.Y.Z` has a `## [X.Y.Z]` heading in CHANGELOG.md, i.e. it is a
  released version and not whatever `main` happened to be that day;
- every `from kadhi_cli.<module> import <name>` in a code cell still resolves
  against the current source tree, so a rename on `main` fails here instead of
  surfacing only when someone bumps the pin.
