"""#654 follow-ups — the two branches its merge comment recorded as uncovered.

#654 fixed the CUDA batch probe to gate on a measured peak rather than on the
absence of an ``OutOfMemoryError``, and recorded two things it did **not**
cover. Both are closed here.

**1. The graceful-degradation branch.** ``_probe_budget_bytes`` returns ``None``
when the driver cannot answer ``mem_get_info``, and ``_probe`` then returns
``True`` — deliberately keeping the pre-#649 exception-only criterion instead of
inventing a budget. Nothing executed that path: the fake in
``test_issue649_batch_probe_peak_gate.py`` builds ``mem_get_info`` as a lambda
that cannot fail. Flipping the branch to ``False`` would make the probe refuse
**every** batch on such a stack, down to ``_MIN_BATCH``, and no test would move.

**2. The ``AcceleratorError`` contract.** ``_is_cuda_oom`` classifies torch's
async-OOM spelling through ``isinstance(exc, RuntimeError)`` — it never names
``AcceleratorError``. That is correct upstream, but the existing test's
``_FakeAcceleratorError`` *also* subclasses ``RuntimeError``, so it passes
whether or not the real class does, and proves nothing about torch.

The merge comment reasoned that no CI cell could check the real assumption,
because the author's box had torch 2.5.1. That does not follow: ``[dev]`` pulls
``[train]``, which declares ``torch>=2.5.0`` — a floor, not a pin — so CI
resolves the newest wheel. Measured in this repo's ``.venv``: torch 2.13.0,
``AcceleratorError`` present, ``issubclass(..., RuntimeError)`` True. So the
guard below **executes** rather than skips. Where the symbol is genuinely
absent it skips with a stated reason rather than passing vacuously — the
convention ``tests/test_issue636_torch_floor.py`` sets for environment-dependent
checks.
