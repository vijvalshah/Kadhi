"""#23 — the MLX `on_val_loss_report` producer.

#713 built the sinks backend-neutrally: a `val_loss` field on `TrainEvent`, a
`val_loss` column on the `metrics` table with a migration, and a `val_loss`
series on `TrainingDisplay`. It wired the transformers producer. This is the
other producer: mlx-lm's `on_val_loss_report`, the item #23's checklist names.

The discipline these tests exist to enforce is the one that blocked #713 in
review: **the sticky value is for the panel only.** A validation pass happens
every N steps, so the last measured value must stay on screen between passes --
but writing that carried-forward value to the database or the SSE wire on every
training step fabricates rows for measurements that never happened. #713's first
version persisted 9 rows for 2 measurements. `TestOnlyRealMeasurementsAreRecorded`
is the guard against a repeat, on this backend.

mlx-lm's payload is built at `mlx_lm/tuner/trainer.py:310-315`:
    val_info = {"iteration": it - 1, "val_loss": <float>, "val_time": <float>}
Note `it - 1`, which differs from the train report's `iteration`. That is
upstream's choice and it is pinned rather than corrected.

    `on_val_loss_report` issues its own `tracker.log_metrics(...)`, and

    So every evaluation appended a row whose three training columns were
    invented, and at a realistic cadence over half the `loss` series a consumer
    reads back was zeros no step ever measured:

    That is the same defect class #713 was blocked on, one column to the left,
    and `log_metrics`'s own docstring makes the argument: a zero there is
    indistinguishable from a genuinely measured zero.

    The fix mirrors the merged transformers producer, which carries
    `_last_loss` / `_last_lr` into the row an evaluation creates
    (`callback.py:205-207`). Measured rather than assumed -- driving the real
    `KadhiTrainerCallback` against a real tracker with three training logs and
    one eval log writes **four** rows, the eval row carrying `loss=2.4`,
    `lr=1e-4` and its own `val_loss`. So an evaluation there does create a
