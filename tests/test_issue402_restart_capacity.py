"""One-active-execution cap survives a server restart (issue #402).

`ExecutionManager._active_run_id` is in-memory: a restarted server starts with
it `None`, sees free capacity, and would launch a second training while a child
from the previous server is still alive. The cap is now gated on a persisted
run whose pid is still alive, so a restart cannot double-book — while a stale
record whose process is gone never blocks execution forever.
