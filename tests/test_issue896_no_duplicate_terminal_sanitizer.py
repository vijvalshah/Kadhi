"""No module but ``utils/terminal.py`` may define its own control-strip table.

v0.75.0 added ``src/kadhi_cli/utils/terminal.py`` (``for_terminal``: strip C0/DEL
control bytes, then escape Rich markup) for the config loader, whose
unknown-key report printed YAML key names unescaped. Six command modules
(``commands/adapters.py``, ``data_canary.py``, ``data_doctor.py``, ``draft.py``,
``infer.py``, ``shrink.py``) plus ``utils/ship_verdict.py`` and
``mcp_server/registry.py`` carried a byte-identical private copy of the same
``_CONTROL_STRIP_TABLE`` under other names -- a seventh (and eighth) private
copy is exactly how the config loader got missed for a release (#896).

This is a repo-wide ratchet, not a one-time cleanup: it fails CI if an eighth
copy is ever reintroduced, mirroring ``test_no_foreign_license_headers.py``'s
approach of using ``git ls-files`` + AST inspection rather than trusting
review to catch a re-added duplicate.

**Name-based detection alone is not enough.** The ninth copy found by hand
while fixing #896 (``commands/serve.py``'s ``--auto-spec`` pairing message)
was a *function-local* variable named ``_ctrl``, not a module-scope
``_CONTROL_STRIP_TABLE`` -- a name-only ratchet locks the door that copy
walked through and leaves open the one it climbed in by (code review on #907).
So this file also matches the table's *shape*, at any scope, under any name:
a dict or dict-comprehension whose iterator is ``range(0x20)``. That pattern
is unique enough in this codebase to have exactly one match -- the real
definer -- confirmed by ``grep -rn "range(0x20)" src/kadhi_cli``.
