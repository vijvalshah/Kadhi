"""v0.72.3 — Layer streaming: breadth.

Six items, each with its own gate because each fails silently in its own way.
Gate numbers and method live in ``.claude/v0723-gate-results.md``.

The inherited standard for every item is unchanged from v0.72.0: **a streamed run
must be bit-exact against the resident run of the same numerics**. What changes
per item is the *reference*, not the standard. Gradient accumulation is the one
exception the brief names — its gate is a measured I/O cost, not an equality.

#: Laptop ~18, A100 SXM 312, H100 SXM ~989, B200 ~2250. Measured *through this
#: probe*: 6.75 TFLOPS on the RTX 3050 dev box at 952 MHz, and 786.5 TFLOPS on
