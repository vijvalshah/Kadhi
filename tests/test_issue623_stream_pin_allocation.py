"""``stream_pin: false`` must reach the store ALLOCATION, not just the panel (#623).

The open half of #623: on a build that HAS ``training.stream_pin``, does
``false`` actually produce a pageable store, or is the key accepted and
ignored while the store lands page-locked? Measured on ``main`` at
``2285b65`` over the real chain with a real CUDA device (RTX 3050 4 GB,
torch 2.6.0+cu124, transformers 5.16.1):

    stream_pin: false  -> src.pinned False, 0/27 store tensors is_pinned()
    default (unset)    -> src.pinned True,  27/27 store tensors is_pinned()

The pair is the point: the second row is the control that makes the first
non-vacuous — page-locking demonstrably happens through this exact chain,
and ``false`` demonstrably prevents it. These tests commit that measurement
so the wiring is an enforced fact instead of a comment-thread claim.

The issue suggested asserting the store is "anonymous (not shmem)". That
discriminator is wrong on the reporter's own stack: the #622 analysis
established that driver-pinned host pages are accounted under ``shmem-rss``
by the kernel (their dumps show 11–14 GB shmem-rss against <300 MB anon-rss
WHILE the store was pinned as requested — their 0.73.3 wheel predated the
field, so the default pinned path ran). Anon-vs-shmem cannot distinguish
"ignored" from "honoured-but-pinned"; ``is_pinned()`` — whether the
allocation went through ``cudaHostAlloc`` or the pageable heap — can, on
every OS.

Two layers, because a full real chain on a simulated CUDA device cannot
allocate GPU buffers:

* the wiring layer runs on EVERY CI cell — the real pre-flight with a
  simulated-CUDA device (``device`` is a string check; ``mem_get_info``
  stubbed — the ``test_v07203.py`` pattern) and ``build_streamed_model``
  spied, asserting the ``pin=`` argument the runtime boundary receives;
* the allocation layer runs on any box with a real CUDA device (skipped
  with a stated reason elsewhere, never silently) — no stubs, real
  ``RamSource``, ``is_pinned()`` on every store tensor, both directions.

Most hops BELOW the runtime boundary are not re-tested here:
``TestRequirePinSurvivesEveryHop`` (test_v07203.py) already drives the real
CPU chain through ``build_streamed_model -> install_streaming ->
_build_source -> RamSource`` for the pin-requested direction, and the
pre-flight note for ``stream_pin: false`` is pinned by
``TestAutoTierFallback``. CPU-only throughout; the tiny checkpoint is the
established harness fixture shape.

One hop below the boundary IS covered here, added once #647 closed the
allocation gap above and left the unpinned RAM-tier construction as the one
remaining piece unprotected on a CUDA-less CI cell:
``TestBuildSourceCpuOnlyPinFalse`` calls ``_build_source(pin=False,
tier="ram")`` directly, no simulation needed, since its unpinned branch never
requests page-locked memory.
