"""Regression coverage for the FSDP per-rank sharding probe (#373).

The probe these tests pin is a measurement harness, not shipped code. It exists
because the STEP 20 probe that established "local params = total / world_size
exactly" at 0.5B raised
``TypeError('FullyShardedDataParallel does not support len()')`` on all eight
ranks at 70B, so no sharding claim could be made there.

The mechanism recorded in the issue body was wrong, and the correction is what
these tests defend. That message is **not** raised by FSDP -- FSDP defines no
``__len__`` at all, and a bare one produces Python's own
``object of type 'X' has no len()``. The recorded text comes from
``torch._dynamo.eval_frame.OptimizedModule.__len__``, which reports the name of
the *wrapped* class. The failing object was therefore a ``torch.compile``
wrapper around FSDP, one indirection deeper than the 0.5B arm.

So "stop calling len()" is necessary but not sufficient: a probe that walks the
tree without unwrapping ``_orig_mod`` never raises and still mis-attributes what
it finds -- it sees ``OptimizedModule`` where the 0.5B record says
``FullyShardedDataParallel``, and concludes FSDP was never engaged. Silent wrong
numbers are worse than a crash, so the unwrapping is pinned here directly.

No GPU, no distributed init and no torch import: the probe's accounting is duck
typed over anything exposing ``parameters()`` / ``named_children()``, and these
doubles reproduce the ``OptimizedModule`` contract including its ``__len__``.
