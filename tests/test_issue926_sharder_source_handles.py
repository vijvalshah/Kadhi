"""#926 — the sharder must not hold every source shard's mapping open.

``shard_checkpoint`` entered every source ``*.safetensors`` into one
``ExitStack`` and kept all the memory maps alive for the whole of pass 2. On
Windows that dies with an access violation once ~96–106 GB of safetensors
mappings are alive in one process, whatever the file count (62 x 1.71 GB and
14 x 6.85 GB both crashed; per-file open/read/close passed — see
``benchmarks/probe-rtx5070-what-bounds-streaming.md`` §12–§14), so a real
Llama-3.1-70B (30 files, 141 GB) could not be sharded there at all.

Three properties are pinned, each discriminating against the shipped code:

- at most ``_MAX_LIVE_SOURCE_HANDLES`` source handles are alive at any moment
  of a sharding run (a counting ``safe_open`` stand-in; the all-handles pattern
  peaks at the FILE COUNT and fails it);
- every tensor the readers return OWNS its memory — ``get_tensor`` is a
  zero-copy view whose storage keeps the WHOLE file mapped for as long as the
  view lives (measured: the view still reads correctly after its handle's
  ``__exit__``), so a retained view would keep a mapping alive past the
  handle's release and defeat the bound;
- splitting the same tensors across many files, with one decoder layer
  straddling a file boundary, changes nothing in the written shards.
