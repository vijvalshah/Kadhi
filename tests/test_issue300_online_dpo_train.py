"""Issue #300 — validate a full online-DPO training run logs a reward metric.

``task='online_dpo'`` (v0.71.31) adapts to the installed TRL:

* **trl <1** — pairwise ``judge=`` (a ``BasePairwiseJudge``),
* **trl 1.x** — pointwise ``reward_funcs=[...]`` (pairwise judges were removed;
  ``OnlineDPOTrainer`` moved to ``trl.experimental.online_dpo``).

The pre-existing suite only validated ``setup()`` (trainer *build*) on trl 1.x —
never a real ``train()`` step on the ``reward_funcs`` path. This smoke test runs
``OnlineDPOTrainerWrapper.train()`` on a tiny model and
asserts a ``rewards/*`` entry appears in ``trainer.state.log_history``, proving
the reward signal is actually applied.

Version-agnostic by design: the wrapper adapts the synthetic length-preferring
evaluator to whichever API the installed trl exposes, so ``pytest -m smoke``
exercises the ``reward_funcs`` path under trl 1.x and the ``judge`` path under
trl <1. Marked ``smoke`` (it runs a real training loop), so it is excluded
from the default fast suite and run explicitly via ``pytest -m smoke``.

Executed live on the new dependency floor, trl 0.29.0 + transformers 5.12.1,
on Apple Silicon CPU: the real training loop completed and logged
rewards/chosen, rewards/rejected, rewards/accuracies, and rewards/margins. The
trl 1.x reward_funcs execution requires a trl>=1.7 + torch>=2.6 env (e.g. CI's
torch-2.6 job) — the same test body exercises it there without modification.
