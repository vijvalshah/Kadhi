"""#968 — pin the bitsandbytes fused-vs-dequant NF4 divergence that #857 rests on.

#857 (merged ``d456a1d3``) moved the NF4 bit-exactness reference in
``tests/test_issue385_stream_dtype.py`` onto the streamed model's *computation
path*: the resident reference now gets ``install_dequant_forward`` applied too.
The justification is that production streams NF4 through ``dequantize_4bit`` +
``F.linear`` (``utils/layer_stream_runtime.py``, the #331 repair), while an
unpatched resident ``Linear4bit`` goes through bitsandbytes' own fused kernel —
so the old comparison was measuring two KERNELS against each other, not
streaming against itself.

That correction is right. The problem #968 records is that after the merge, the
property it rests on is asserted NOWHERE: it survives only in two docstrings.
A bitsandbytes release that fixed the fused path would make the correction
unnecessary and nothing would say so; a release that worsened it would change
the magnitude and nothing would notice.

So this file asserts the property directly, with **no streaming anywhere in the
experiment**. Two resident NF4 models are built from the same checkpoint, their
packed weights are asserted byte-identical, and the only difference between them
is whether ``install_dequant_forward`` was applied. On sm_120 with bitsandbytes
0.50.2 they disagree; with the patch applied to BOTH (or to NEITHER) they agree
exactly, which is what makes the divergence attributable to the path and not to
the harness.

WHAT THE "FUSED" PATH ACTUALLY IS, in bitsandbytes 0.50.2. ``#331``'s docstring
names ``MatMul4Bit``, which is where the *aliasing* bug lives, but numerically
both routes land on the same kernel: ``matmul_4bit`` calls
``torch.ops.bitsandbytes.gemm_4bit`` directly when no gradient is needed and
``MatMul4Bit.apply`` otherwise, and ``MatMul4Bit.forward`` calls that same op.
Measured: the divergence below is bit-identical under ``torch.no_grad()`` and
under ``torch.enable_grad()``, which is the evidence for that reading.

THE DIVERGENCE IS SHAPE-GATED, and this is the part that is easy to get wrong.
``gemm_4bit`` only runs its own fused dequantise-and-multiply for a small
leading dimension; above it, bitsandbytes dequantises and calls a normal GEMM,
which agrees with our path bit-for-bit. Measured on this card at
``M in {1..32}`` -> divergent, ``M >= 33`` -> exactly 0.0. That is why
``test_issue385``'s ``(1, 12)`` input sees the divergence at all, and it is the
trap the first attempt at this probe fell into (see the class docstring in
``TestTheDivergenceIsGatedOnTheLeadingDimension``).

This can only ever be a dev-box signal: GitHub runners have no GPU, so the whole
module skips in CI, exactly like its neighbours in ``test_issue385_stream_dtype``.
It is additionally pinned to the bitsandbytes version it was measured against, so
a version bump reports "unverified" rather than silently passing.

**#968 does not resolve #776.** Which of the two bitsandbytes paths is
numerically CORRECT on sm_120 is still unestablished. This file pins that they
differ, and by how much.

Environment the constants below were measured on: RTX 5070 Laptop GPU (sm_120),
driver 616.92 / CUDA 13.4, torch 2.14.0+cu130, bitsandbytes 0.50.2,
transformers 5.17.0, peft 0.20.0, Python 3.12.10, Windows 11.

    1. It called ``bnb.functional.matmul_4bit``, which does not exist in
       bitsandbytes 0.50.2 — the symbol is ``bnb.matmul_4bit``. Against the very
       version it pinned itself to, it raised ``AttributeError`` and could never
       have passed.
    2. Repairing that is not enough. It probed ``rows in (64, 2048)`` and
       asserted a NON-ZERO gap at 64 — but the fused kernel only runs up to
       ``M = 32``, so both of its shapes sit on the side where the two paths
       agree exactly and its positive assertion was unsatisfiable.
