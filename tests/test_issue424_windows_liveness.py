"""Windows STILL_ACTIVE (259) exit-code ambiguity in process liveness (issue #424).

`GetExitCodeProcess` reports `STILL_ACTIVE` (259) for a running process, but 259
is also a legal process exit code — a process that exits *with* 259 used to be
indistinguishable from one still running and read ALIVE forever. The fix uses
`WaitForSingleObject(handle, 0)`: the process handle becomes signalled the
instant the process exits, independent of its exit code.
