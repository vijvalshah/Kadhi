"""Reconcile-on-read for runs whose watcher never unwound (issue #401).

`ExecutionManager._watch` runs as a daemon thread; when the MCP server exits it
is killed without running `finish_execution`, leaving the run at 'running'
forever. The tracker's read path reconciles such a row by checking whether the
recorded PID is still alive.
