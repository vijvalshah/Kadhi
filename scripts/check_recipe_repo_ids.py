"""Resolve every shipped recipe's Hugging Face repo id, anonymously (#677).

The catalog names a repo in two independent places per recipe -- ``RecipeMeta.model``
and the YAML ``base:`` -- and until now nothing checked that either resolves.
#661 found two that did not; both had shipped and been released, because
``validate-recipes`` parses the YAML through the real schema and a nonexistent
repo id is a perfectly well-formed string.

Three things this deliberately does NOT do, each of which would make the guard
worse than nothing:

**It does not treat a status code as evidence.** An invented repo id returns the
same ``401`` from the Hub API as a real private one -- the mistake made in #661
before that report was worth filing. The authoritative signal is
``huggingface_hub``'s ``RepositoryNotFoundError``.

**It does not report gated repos.** A gated repo (``meta-llama/*``, ``google/gemma-*``)
resolves for an authorised user and refuses an anonymous one. Reporting those
would fire forever on correct recipes, and a guard that cries wolf gets muted.
``model_info`` exposes ``gated``; this reads it rather than inferring.

**It does not report a transient failure as a missing repo.** Timeouts, 5xx and
rate limits classify as UNVERIFIED -- "could not check" -- after retries. A bad
minute at the Hub must not become a bug report.

Run by ``.github/workflows/recipe-repo-ids.yml`` on a schedule. Never on pull
requests: 163 network calls per PR would make every unrelated change depend on
Hub availability.
