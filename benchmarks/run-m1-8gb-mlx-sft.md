Five completed runs and one failure, captured from the printed output of the
harness in `harness/mlx_sft_smoke.py` on an 8 GB M1. The failure and the two
corrections I made while measuring are left in, in the order they happened.

# MLX SFT on an 8 GB M1 — where the ceiling actually is

**Status: FIVE RUNS COMPLETED, ONE FIXTURE FAILED. This is not a gate.** It
establishes that `MLXSFTTrainerWrapper`'s training loop runs end to end against a
real MLX runtime, and it measures peak memory and throughput on the low-memory
end of Apple Silicon. It does **not** establish correctness of the resulting
adapters beyond "they load and the loss falls" — see *What this does not
establish*, which is longer than the results on purpose.

Filed against #23, which
asked for exactly this and had been open since v0.25.0 because CI has no Apple
Silicon and the maintainer has no Mac.

## Why this box

`benchmarks/gate-qwen4-ple-m4-max.md` is already an Apple Silicon record, so this
is **not** the first non-CUDA row — a framing worth correcting before it
propagates. That record is PyTorch/MPS, covers Qwen4 decoder mapping, and states
plainly that it "must not be read as a throughput, peak-memory, or production-
trainability claim."

What is new here is narrower and worth stating exactly:

- the first measurement of the **MLX backend's training loop** rather than the
  transformers/MPS path;
- the first **throughput and peak-memory** figures from Apple Silicon;
- **8 GB**, against the 128 GiB M4 Max of that record and the M4 of
  #362. A footprint problem
  shows up here or nowhere.

Unit convention: **GB as MLX reports them** (`mx.get_peak_memory()`), which is
GiB-based. Host figures come from `memory_pressure` and `sysctl vm.swapusage`.

## Configuration

| | |
|---|---|
| Machine | Apple M1, 8 GB unified memory, 8 cores |
| OS / Python | macOS 26.6.2, arm64, Python 3.12.14 |
| MLX | `mlx` 0.32.2, `mlx-lm` 0.31.3, Metal available |
| Config | `backend: mlx`, `task: sft`, LoRA r=8 α=16, `batch_size: 1`, `gradient_accumulation_steps: 1`, `max_length: 512`, `lr: 1e-4` |
| Data | 48 synthetic chatml rows, 1 epoch -> 48 iterations (48 rows / `batch_size` 1 / `gradient_accumulation_steps` 1) |
| Harness | [`harness/mlx_sft_smoke.py`](harness/mlx_sft_smoke.py) |

**Dispatch was asserted, not assumed.** Every run checks
`resolve_trainer(cfg)` returns `MLXSFTTrainerWrapper` *before* the timer starts
and aborts otherwise. This is not ceremony:
#363 was `backend: mlx`
never reaching the MLX trainer at all, so a plausible-looking number here could
have been the transformers path. @nicolasramos flagged exactly this when handing
the issue over, and the check is in the harness because of it.

## Results

All five completed runs, in the order they ran. `peak` is MLX's own
`get_peak_memory()`; the per-iteration `Peak mem` mlx-lm prints is given where it
differs.

| model (4-bit) | load | peak after load | train, 48 it | **peak in train** | mlx-lm peak | **host free before -> after** | swap total -> | trained tokens | **tok/s** | loss | adapter | reload |

**How tok/s is derived, because an earlier revision of this table got it wrong.**
Every figure is `trained tokens / train seconds` — a **whole-run average**, computed
by the harness and printed as its `throughput` line, so the Reproducing section
below regenerates this column rather than leaving it unaccounted for.

It is **not** mlx-lm's printed `Tokens/sec`. That value is *instantaneous per
report*: within the single 0.5B run below it ranged **19.192 to 254.313**. The
first published version of this table quoted a late per-report reading (`~240`)
for row 1 while every other column in the row was whole-run, which made that row
internally inconsistent by 2.2x. See *Corrections* below.

The internal check that catches this, and that the corrected table now passes:
rows 1 and 3 share the **Qwen2** tokenizer over identical inputs, so their
trained-token totals must be equal — `2,130 == 2,130`. Rows 2 and 4 share
**Llama3** — `2,316 == 2,316`. That pins ~44-48 tokens per iteration across the
grid, which the corrected tok/s column is consistent with and the original was
not.

**Which peak is the headline.** The bolded `peak in train` column is
`mx.get_peak_memory()`, sampled by the harness after `train()` returns. The
`mlx-lm peak` column is mlx-lm's own per-iteration high-water mark, which is
strictly the larger of the two and is what its progress output prints. **Quote
the mlx-lm figure** — 5.154 GB for the 8B — when citing a ceiling, because it is
the true maximum the process reached; the harness reading can miss a transient
in-step spike.

**Peak and free unified memory are the load-bearing columns here**, not tok/s: on
8 GB shared with the OS the ceiling is the interesting variable. Both 7B and 8B
end at **14% host free**, and the swap file more than triples across those two
rungs — the machine absorbs them rather than refusing, which is the mechanism
section below.

`load` includes the first-time Hub download, so it is a network figure, not a
model-load figure.

### The headline

**`llama3.1-8b-sft-mlx` — the shipped recipe — trains on an 8 GB M1.** Peak
5.154 GB, 48 iterations in 71 s, adapter written and reloadable.

I predicted before running that it would not fit, and said so on the issue. It
fits. The prediction was wrong and the measurement is the reason this row exists.

### Two things I cannot explain and am not going to smooth over

**7B is slower than 8B.** `Qwen2.5-7B` runs at **31.5 tok/s** against
`Llama-3.1-8B`'s **32.6**, despite being the smaller model, and its `It/sec` is
lower across every reported iteration. The anomaly **survives the tok/s
correction** — it was present in the original figures and is present in the
whole-run averages that replaced them, so it is not an artifact of the
measurement mix-up. Candidate explanations I did **not** test: Qwen2.5's larger
vocabulary (151,936 vs 128,256) making the output projection dominate at this
tiny sequence length; different host memory pressure between the two rungs (the
7B rung ran with 14% host memory free at its end, the 8B rung also 14%, but swap
had grown between them). Stated as an observation, not a mechanism.

**Adapter reload time scales far worse than size.** 0.9 s -> 2.1 s -> 15.8 s ->
23.8 s across a 6x span of adapter size. The reload re-reads the full base model,
so this is dominated by base weights, not the adapter — but 15.8 s for 7B against
23.8 s for 8B is steeper than the parameter ratio, and I did not isolate it.

### Host behaviour

The interesting mechanism is that **a model too big for RAM does not fail here —
it pages.** macOS grew the swap file through the run (2048 -> 3072 -> 4096 ->
8192 -> 9216 MB) and free memory sat at 5-6% for long stretches while `ls /`
still returned in 16 ms. MLX memory-maps weights, so most of the model is
file-backed and evictable; low "free memory" is the normal shape of this
workload, not distress.

That has a direct consequence for anyone writing a pre-flight for this backend:
**an allocation-failure check would not fire.** It is the same trap as the WDDM
spill in #649 — "the step
did not raise" is not "the step fits" — arrived at from the opposite platform.

---

## The failure: the fixture #23 recommends does not load

Issue #23 names `mlx-community/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-4bit` as the tiny test
model. It cannot be used:

```
FileNotFoundError: No safetensors found in
  ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-4bit/snapshots/01a7088...
```

The repo exists and resolves. Its file list, last modified **2024-01-05**:

```
config.json  special_tokens_map.json  tokenizer.json  tokenizer_config.json
weights.00.safetensors
```

`mlx_lm` 0.31.3 fetches `allow_patterns=["model*.safetensors", ...]`
(`utils.py:237-239`) and `load_model` globs `model*.safetensors`
(`utils.py:316`). The legacy `weights.NN.safetensors` naming matches neither, so
the weights are never downloaded and the load fails on the tokenizer-only
snapshot. Nothing is wrong with the repo; the naming convention predates the one
mlx-lm now requires.

**Anyone writing the CI job in #23 should not use that model id.**
`mlx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-4bit` is the smallest fixture verified
working here (282 MB, 19.7 s for 48 iterations).

---

## What this does not establish

- **No correctness claim.** Loss falls and the adapter reloads. Nothing here
  compares MLX output against a transformers reference, checks gradient
  exactness, or evaluates the tuned model. "It trains" is the claim; "it trains
  *correctly*" is not.
- **The data is synthetic and trivial** — 48 rows of short Q/A, deliberately
  repetitive. A loss falling from 3.6 to 0.1 on 48 repeated rows is memorisation,
  not evidence of learning. It is a smoke signal, nothing more.
- **`target_modules: auto` means Q/V only here.** Every run printed
  `auto cannot be resolved for all architectures; defaulting to
  ['self_attn.q_proj', 'self_attn.v_proj']`. This is deliberate — see
  #392, where shipping
  `{"keys": ["auto"]}` silently dropped every LoRA tensor — but it means these
  loss curves are Q/V-only LoRA, not all-linear, and are not comparable with
  CUDA-path numbers that resolved `auto` differently.
- **One box, one run per rung. No repeats, so there is no spread** — and a
  later re-run shows the spread is large. Re-running `Qwen2.5-0.5B` at the same
  48 rows from a warm cache on a quieter machine gave
  **373.1 tok/s (2,130 tokens / 5.7 s) against 108.1 in the table** — the same
  model, the same config, the same whole-run metric, **3.5x apart**. The
  difference is host conditions and a warm Hub cache, not method. Treat every
  tok/s figure here as an order of magnitude, not a benchmark. The T4 record set
  the precedent for not quoting throughput off a single constrained run; this row
  is bound by the same limit.

  (An earlier revision of this bullet compared *instantaneous* per-report values
  against the table and reported "355-480 tok/s". Both halves of that comparison
  were the wrong metric; it is restated above with whole-run averages on both
  sides.)
- **`load` is polluted by download time.** First-time Hub fetches dominate it.
  A warm-cache load was not measured separately.
- **Host pressure varied between rungs** and was not controlled. Swap grew
  monotonically across the session.
- **DPO and GRPO are untouched.** `_validate_mlx_task` rejects them at config
  load; only SFT was exercised.

## Corrections made while measuring

Both are mine, both were caught before they reached a claim, and both are the
reason the numbers above are worth anything.

1. **A bare HTTP 401 from the Hub proves nothing.** I initially read 401 as
   "model does not exist" and asserted on that basis that
   `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-4bit` was missing. A repo id I invented returns the
   same 401. The correct instrument is `huggingface_hub.model_info`, which
   distinguishes `RepositoryNotFoundError` from a gated-but-present repo. This
   mattered beyond the fixture choice — it is what put
   #661 on evidence rather
   than on a status code.
2. **`target_modules: auto` degrading to Q/V is not a defect.** I recorded it as
   one, then found #392 and the docstring explaining why it is deliberate. It
   belongs in this record as context for reading the loss curves, not as a bug.

3. **The tok/s column mixed two different measurements.** Row 1 quoted `~240`,
   a late instantaneous `Tokens/sec` reading from mlx-lm's stdout, while its
   train time and every other row were whole-run. Caught in review by
   @MakazhanAlpamys, who noticed rows 1 and 3 share a tokenizer and identical
   inputs yet implied 98.5 against 46.5 tokens per iteration — 2.12x apart, so
   they could not both be right. He derived the true ~45 tok/iteration from
   captured mlx-lm dicts in my own sibling PR. The whole-run average for row 1
   is **108.1 tok/s**, not 240. The harness now computes the figure so the
   column cannot drift from the method again.

Also lost and re-run: the TinyLlama rung's output was truncated by a `tail -120`
in my own ladder invocation, so the failure above was re-measured from scratch
rather than reconstructed.

## Reproducing

The current harness also exercises the Rich display and experiment-tracker
bridge added in #665. It saves `experiments.db` beside the temporary artifacts,
leaving the user's usual experiment database untouched, and fails if no display
updates or tracker metrics arrive. The bridge emits its normal process-local
SSE events too. No separate UI server is started.

The measurements above predate this wiring; they have not been re-run with the
bridge enabled. New runs include display/tracker overhead in the training wall
time. Throughput still uses mlx-lm's cumulative trained-token count captured
inside the stdout tee, not the display's iterations-per-second value.

```bash
pip install -e ".[mlx]"
python benchmarks/harness/mlx_sft_smoke.py mlx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-4bit 48 1
```

The harness pins `batch_size: 1` and `gradient_accumulation_steps: 1`, so those
48 rows are **48 optimizer steps**. Both are stated here for the same reason the
model id and the row count are: the throughput figures below are per-step work,
and a reader reproducing this needs the step count to be reproducible too rather
than inherited from whatever the config schema defaults to at the time. The
harness resolves both counts from the loaded config and, if either is not
`rows * epochs`, exits non-zero before training starts, naming the iteration
count, the optimizer-update count and any rows the rounding would drop.

It prints the throughput line this table's tok/s column is taken from:

```
train         : 19.7s   mlx peak during train: 0.463 GB
throughput    : 108.1 tok/s  (2130 trained tokens / 19.7s, whole-run average)
```

Requires Apple Silicon. The harness asserts MLX dispatch before measuring and
prints host memory before and after, so a run on another box is directly
comparable to the table above.
