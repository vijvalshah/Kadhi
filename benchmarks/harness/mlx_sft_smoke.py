"""End-to-end MLX SFT smoke run through Kadhi's own trainer wrapper (#23).

Drives ``MLXSFTTrainerWrapper`` rather than ``mlx_lm`` directly: the point of
#23 is that the *wrapper's* training loop had never run against a real MLX
runtime, so calling mlx-lm here would test the wrong thing.

Asserts MLX dispatch BEFORE the timer starts. #363 was ``backend: mlx`` never
reaching the MLX trainer, which means a plausible number can be the transformers
path wearing a disguise; the assert is what stops this harness publishing one.

Fixture is generated in-process — no external data file — so a run on another
machine is directly comparable to `benchmarks/run-m1-8gb-mlx-sft.md`.

Requires Apple Silicon and ``pip install -e ".[mlx]"``.

Attaches Kadhi's Rich display and a local experiment tracker, and refuses a run
with no bridge metrics. The database stays beside the temporary artifacts;
the bridge also emits its normal process-local SSE events. Timing includes
display/tracker overhead, unlike the original published M1 measurements.

Usage:
    python mlx_sft_smoke.py [model-id] [rows] [epochs]

The exact commands behind every row of `benchmarks/run-m1-8gb-mlx-sft.md`,
so the table reproduces without reading the thread (8 GB M1, mlx 0.32.2 /
mlx-lm 0.31.3, 48 rows / 1 epoch each):

    python mlx_sft_smoke.py mlx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-4bit  48 1
    python mlx_sft_smoke.py mlx-community/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-4bit  48 1
    python mlx_sft_smoke.py mlx-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-4bit    48 1
    python mlx_sft_smoke.py mlx-community/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-4bit  48 1

The last is the model the shipped `llama3.1-8b-sft-mlx` recipe names; it peaks
at 5.154 GB and completes. The first is the smallest verified-good fixture
(282 MB) and is what a CI job should use.

Known-bad: mlx-community/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-4bit ships the legacy
``weights.NN.safetensors`` naming, which mlx-lm's ``model*.safetensors`` glob
does not match. It fails with "No safetensors found".
