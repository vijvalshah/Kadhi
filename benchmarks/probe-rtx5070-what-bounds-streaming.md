# What bounds layer streaming on an RTX 5070 Laptop — a new baseline, not a comparison

**Status: THREE SECTIONS MEASURED (2026-09-12). §1 the RAM tier on a 7B NF4;
§2 the shipped disk tier on the same 7B with the page cache warm; §3 the
shipped disk tier COLD on a synthetic 70B-shaped NF4 store larger than RAM —
which first surfaced a shipped sharder defect (#926, §12–§14). Raw per-point JSON
for every block is under `benchmarks/results/probe-rtx5070/`.**

The dev box changed on 2026-09-10 (CLAUDE.md header). Every published
streaming number is from an RTX 3050 4 GB; this card has twice the VRAM, a
different architecture and a PCIe 5.0 x8 link, so **nothing here is compared
against a stored number** — this is the first baseline on this card, and the
question is the same one `probe-v0.73.0-what-bounds-streaming.md` asked of the
old one: is the streamed step bound by the bus, by the GPU, or by something
streaming adds?

Two things differ from that record, stated up front:

- **The model is Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (unsloth mirror), not Llama-3.1-8B.**
  Llama-3.1 is gated and this box has no Hub token. Mistral-7B is in the
  streaming allowlist since v0.72.3, has the same per-layer shape (hidden
  4096, intermediate 14336, 8 KV heads, 32 layers, **218.1M params per layer,
  112.5 MB per NF4 layer**) and a 32768 vocabulary instead of 128256, so the
  logits term is 4x smaller. Same layer, smaller head.
- **The harness is checked in.** The v0.73.0 probe's scripts were scratchpad
  files that left with the machine (#379). `benchmarks/harness/stream_probe.py`
  builds the model through the SHIPPED path (`shard_checkpoint` ->
  `build_streamed_model`), replicates the two shipped copy paths with CUDA
  events added (a source guard refuses to run if the shipped body drifts), and
  writes JSON after every point.

Unit convention: **decimal GB**, matching the other records.

---

## 0. Two things went wrong before the first number

1. **The "cached" Mistral had no weights.** `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` listed
   `models--unsloth--mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3`, and I read that directory name
   as "downloaded". It held config and tokenizer only; the three safetensors
   shards (14.5 GB) were fetched by the probe's own `resolve_model_weights`
   at ~2 GB/min, unauthenticated, before any measurement. Lesson: a hub cache
   directory is evidence of a *visit*, not of weights.
2. **A foreign CPU-bound process was running on the box** (`Kadhi_Connectome_Runtime`,
   ~1180 s of CPU by 20:19, writing 100 MB blocks) during the download and
   shard phases. It had exited by the time the timed steps started (system CPU
   load 16% at 20:24; sharding finished after the download). The timed numbers
   below were taken with it gone; the download/shard timings were not.
3. **The System log carries a `Kernel-Power 105: Power source change` at
   20:19:57**, i.e. during the download, before any timed step. At the time of
   writing the box is on AC (`Win32_Battery.BatteryStatus=2`, 59% and
   charging, scheme Balanced, GPU P0, `clocks.max.sm` 3090 MHz). Every timed
   number in this record was taken on AC; whether a charging battery shares
   the power budget with the GPU on this laptop is not known, and it is one
   candidate for the in-session ceiling drift in §2.

---

## 1. Setup and the two costs that are not the step

| | |
|---|---|
| model | unsloth/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3, NF4 + double quant, 32 layers, untied head |
| store | **4.138 GB pinned** RAM (page-locked on first attempt; no fallback) |
| buffers | 2 x 112.5 MB decoder + one 268.4 MB large slot (embed / lm_head, bf16) |
| adapter | LoRA r=8, alpha 16, q/k/v/o; PagedAdamW8bit, lr 1e-4 |
| shape | batch 1, seq 512, synthetic ids, labels = ids |
| sharding | **19.6 s** (NF4 quantised on the GPU, one tensor at a time) |
| build | **4.6 s** (meta skeleton -> extras -> LoRA -> pinned store) |

Sharding 14.5 GB of bf16 into 4.1 GB of NF4 in 19.6 s is worth recording on
its own: the shard cache is a one-time cost of well under a minute here.

## 2. GEMM ceiling, same session

| probe | TFLOPS | reported SM clock |
|---|---|---|
| shipped square 4096^3, best-of-3 (samples 15.21 / 26.78 / 27.95 — boost ramping) | **27.95** | 1867 MHz |
| shape-matched at M=512: q/o 512x4096x4096 | 41.22 | |
| k/v 512x4096x1024 | 26.60 | |
| gate/up 512x4096x14336 | 30.40 | |
| down 512x14336x4096 | 29.63 | |
| **FLOP-weighted per layer** | **31.71** | 1657 MHz |
| the same two probes at the END of the session | 39.92 / **34.97** | 1530 MHz |

**The ceiling moved 10% inside one session**, and in the direction opposite to
the reported clock (a higher rate at a lower instantaneous reading). The clock
column is a point sample from `nvidia-smi`, and on this card the boost state
evidently changes faster than that sample resolves. Every fraction-of-ceiling
below is therefore quoted against the START value (31.71) with a ±10% band, and
nothing below turns on that fraction.

For scale: the RTX 3050's shape-matched ceiling was 7.55 TFLOPS. **This card is
~4.2x the old one on the GEMMs that matter.**

## 3. The headline step, and where its time goes

CUDA-event instrumentation on the copy stream and the compute stream, same
method as the v0.73.0 record (§3): copy time is how long the transfers take on
their own stream; stall is the interval the compute stream sits blocked in
`wait_event` — the only part of a transfer that is not hidden.

| quantity | per step | share |
|---|---|---|
| step time (8 timed steps, spread 1.041–1.069 s) | **1.053 s** | 100% |
| throughput | **486.0 tok/s** (486.3 instrumented — free) | |
| layer loads (measured, prefetcher skips owned slots) | 61.0 + 2 large | |
| bytes moved | 61 x 112.5 MB + 2 x 268.4 MB = **7.40 GB** | |
| copy time on the prefetch stream | **0.443 s** | **42%** |
| copy-stream rate | **16.7 GB/s** (PCIe 5.0 x8 pinned) | |
| average rate over the step | 7.03 GB/s | |
| **compute stream stalled on a copy** | **3.5 ms** | **0.34%** |
| effective rate (C=6 decoder, C=4 head: 42.41 GFLOP/token) | **20.6 TFLOPS** | 65% of ceiling (58% vs the end value) |
| peak VRAM | 1.342 GB allocated / 1.437 GB reserved | |

**Finding 3 — transfers are still hidden, but the margin is gone from 5.7x to
2.4x.** On the 3050 the copy stream was busy 17.5% of the step; here it is busy
42%. A card ~2.4x faster than this one at this shape, or this card at a
quarter of the tokens per step, is transfer-bound on this link. The stall says
the double buffer is still doing its job today.

**Cross-check against the old card.** The 3050 ran the 8B NF4 step (same
per-layer shape, bigger head) in 4.19 s; this card runs the 7B step in 1.05 s —
**4.0x**, against a 4.2x GEMM ceiling ratio. Compute-bound scaling, as the
stall number says.

## 4. The ablations, interleaved

Four arms switched by flag inside ONE process, A/B/C/D per round, two rounds.
Arms B, C and D compute garbage and are timing-only: B leaves stale bytes in
the pool (skips both the source read and the H2D copy), C multiplies by a
cached zero weight instead of dequantising, D does both.

| arm | round 0 | round 1 | vs A |
|---|---|---|---|
| A baseline | 1.065 s / 480.8 tok/s | 1.063 s / 481.8 | — |
| B **no host-to-device copies** | 0.994 s / 515.3 | 1.003 s / 510.6 | **−6.7% / −5.6%** |
| C **no NF4 dequantisation** | 0.819 s / 625.0 | 0.820 s / 624.7 | **−23.1% / −22.9%** |
| D neither | 0.780 s / 656.1 | 0.803 s / 637.6 | **−26.7% / −24.4%** |

Round-to-round spread: A 0.2%, B 0.9%, C 0.1%, D 2.9%.

**Finding 4 — the two streaming-specific costs are 25% of the step here, and
the split has inverted.** On the 3050 they were 11.3% (1.4% copies, 9.8%
dequant). Here copies are ~6% and the **NF4 dequantisation is ~23%** — the
per-visit `dequantize_4bit` into a dense bf16 tensor (the cost of the #331
repair) writes ~437 MB of VRAM per layer visit, and that write does not get
4.2x faster when the GEMMs do. **#842 (a checkpoint-visible fused
dequantise-and-multiply) is worth up to a quarter of the step on this card, not
a tenth.**

**Finding 4b — with both removed, 74% of the step remains, at ~27.5 TFLOPS =
87% of the start ceiling (79% of the end value).** The eager per-layer loop is
close to the GEMM ceiling once streaming's own costs are gone; the "gap to
ceiling" pool that was 28.7% on the 3050 is 13–21% here.

## 5. Sequence sweep: the fixed cost, and where the copy stops hiding

Batch 1, 8 timed steps per point, instrumentation on.

| tokens | step | tok/s | copy on its stream | stall | peak VRAM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 0.497 s | 32.2 | 0.368 s | 49 ms | 1.073 GB |
| 32 | 0.514 s | 62.2 | 0.368 s | 40 ms | 1.079 GB |
| 64 | 0.508 s | 126.0 | 0.369 s | 40 ms | 1.090 GB |
| 128 | 0.498 s | 257.1 | 0.367 s | 38 ms | 1.118 GB |
| 256 | 0.694 s | 368.8 | 0.376 s | 7.7 ms | 1.193 GB |
| 384 | 0.849 s | 452.2 | 0.413 s | 5.8 ms | 1.270 GB |
| 512 | 1.067 s | 479.8 | 0.454 s | 3.7 ms | 1.342 GB |

Least squares over 128–512: **step(S) = 0.311 s + 1.455 ms/token**, asymptote
687 tok/s. At S=512 that is 29% fixed / 71% proportional (the 3050 was 11% /
88%: the proportional part shrank 4.9x, the fixed part only 1.5x).

**Finding 5 — below ~128 tokens the step is a flat ~0.5 s, and it is NOT the
copies.** The copy stream is busy 0.37 s of that 0.5 s, but the compute stream
stalls on it for only 40–50 ms; the rest is the per-layer-visit CPU-side
overhead the v0.73.0 record measured at ~10 ms/visit (#841). On this card it is
~7 ms/visit (0.5 s / 64 visits) and it now binds up to ~200 tokens per step,
because the arithmetic it used to hide behind got 4x faster while the Python
did not. **The crossover moved up, not down: a faster GPU makes #841 worse.**

## 6. Section-1 verdict, one sentence

**On the RAM tier this card is compute-bound at batch 1 x 512 — the compute
stream waits on a copy 0.34% of the step and deleting every host-to-device byte
buys 6% — but the copy stream is now 42% occupied and the NF4 dequantisation is
23% of the step, so the two levers, in order, are #842 (fused dequant, up to
~23%) and #841 (per-visit fixed cost, binding below ~200 tokens), and the
transfer term becomes the bound at roughly 2.4x this card's speed or a quarter
of these tokens per step.**

What this does NOT say: anything about the disk tier, about batch > 1, about
bf16 streaming, or about a resident reference (an 8B does not fit resident on
8 GB at this shape either). Those follow.

## 7. What was NOT measured in Section 1

- **A resident baseline.** Not attempted; the point of this section is the
  decomposition, and the bit-exactness question on this card is #776.
- **bf16 streaming** and **batch > 1** under the ablation method.
- **Whether a fused dequantise-and-multiply recovers the 23%.** Arm C measures
  what removing the dequantisation is worth, not what a real fused kernel
  costs.
- **The clock.** `nvidia-smi` point samples disagreed with the measured rates
  in direction; a sustained-clock trace (dmon) was not run.

---

# SECTION 2 — the shipped disk tier, same model, page cache WARM

**Status: MEASURED (2026-09-12). This is the first RAM-vs-disk number the
project has (#325), and it is a measurement of the read PATH, not of the
NVMe: a 4.1 GB store on a 31.7 GB box sits entirely in the page cache.**

Same shards, same adapter, same shapes; `--tier disk` builds the shipped
`DiskSource` (one `safe_open` handle per layer, `get_tensor` on demand,
pageable, no pinning). The GEMM ceiling re-measured in this session: square
43.12 / shape-matched 36.26 TFLOPS at the start, 34.56 at the end.

## 8. The headline step from disk

| quantity | RAM tier (§3) | disk tier, warm |
|---|---|---|
| step | 1.053 s | **2.46 s** uninstrumented (spread 1.70–3.01) / **2.89 s** instrumented (2.77–2.94) |
| throughput | 486 tok/s | **177–208 tok/s** |
| "copy" bracket on the prefetch stream | 0.443 s | **1.72 s** (4.3 GB/s) |
| compute stream stalled on a copy event | 3.5 ms | **0.2 ms** |
| peak VRAM | 1.342 GB | 1.342 GB |

Two readings that only make sense together. First, the bracket on the copy
stream now includes the CPU-side `get_tensor` that runs BEFORE the copy is
enqueued, so "4.3 GB/s" is the rate of mmap page-cache read + pageable
staging + H2D, not of PCIe. Second, the compute-stream stall is essentially
ZERO even though the step is 2.3–2.8x longer: the compute stream never waits
on the copy event because the **Python thread itself is blocked inside
`get_tensor` and cannot enqueue the next layer's kernels**. The GPU starves,
and the starvation appears as wall time, not as a stall. That is the
mechanism, and it is the thing an async tier has to fix: the read must leave
the compute thread, not merely get faster.

Uninstrumented was faster than instrumented here (2.46 vs 2.89 s) with a
1.70–3.01 s spread; on the RAM tier the two agreed to 0.06%. The disk path's
variance is the page cache's, and the instrumented figure is the one the
ablation rounds reproduced (2.88–3.02 s).

## 9. Sweep from disk: flat from 16 to 512 tokens

| tokens | step | tok/s | bracket | stall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | 2.756 s | 5.8 | 1.729 s | 2.6 ms |
| 32 | 2.880 s | 11.1 | 1.800 s | 2.7 ms |
| 64 | 2.779 s | 23.0 | 1.761 s | 2.7 ms |
| 128 | 2.905 s | 44.1 | 1.848 s | 2.8 ms |
| 256 | 2.938 s | 87.1 | 1.844 s | 2.8 ms |
| 384 | 2.920 s | 131.5 | 1.807 s | 1.2 ms |
| 512 | 2.958 s | 173.1 | 1.749 s | 0.3 ms |

**Finding 9 — the disk tier is I/O-path-bound at every token count.** The
step does not move between 16 and 512 tokens; the entire RAM-tier
proportional term (0.75 s at 512) hides under the read. Tokens per step are
free until the read is hidden, which is the amortisation argument in one
table: on this tier, batch is the lever and it costs nothing until ~1000
tokens.

## 10. Ablation from disk

| arm | round 0 | round 1 | vs A |
|---|---|---|---|
| A baseline | 3.020 s / 169.5 tok/s | 2.881 s / 177.7 | — |
| B **no source read, no copy** | **1.043 s / 490.8** | **1.058 s / 483.7** | **−65.5% / −63.3%** |
| C no NF4 dequantisation | 2.756 s / 185.8 | 2.811 s / 182.2 | −8.7% / −2.4% |
| D neither | 0.851 s / 601.9 | 0.832 s / 615.4 | −71.8% / −71.1% |

**Finding 10 — arm B is the RAM tier, to the millisecond.** Removing the read
path returns 1.04–1.06 s, i.e. §3's 1.053 s. So the shipped disk tier costs
**~1.9 s per step on top of the RAM tier, with the whole store in the page
cache**, for 7.4 GB moved: an effective 3.9 GB/s through
mmap -> tensor -> pageable `copy_`. The dequantisation (23% on the RAM tier)
is worth 2–9% here because it hides under the read. A cold store, one that
does not fit the page cache, can only be slower than this; that is Section 3.

## 11. What Section 2 does NOT say

- Nothing about NVMe throughput: no byte reached the SSD during the timed
  steps (4.1 GB store, 31.7 GB RAM, the shards had just been written).
- Nothing about a pinned staging path or a reader thread — neither exists in
  the shipped code (`DiskSource.get` is a synchronous `get_tensor`, prefetch
  depth is exactly one layer). This section measures the shipped path only.

---

# SECTION 3 — a cold store: the sharder crashed first

**Status: BLOCKED ON A SHIPPED DEFECT, found and reproduced 2026-09-12.**

The cold measurement needs a store that cannot fit the page cache. No 70B
checkpoint is on this box and Llama-3.1-70B is gated, so
`benchmarks/harness/synth_checkpoint.py` (new) writes a Llama-70B-SHAPED
checkpoint with random N(0, 0.02) weights: 80 layers of hidden 8192 /
intermediate 28672 / 8 KV heads, **855.6M params per layer, 441.4 MB per NF4
layer**, and a 32k head so the resident large slot is 0.5 GB rather than 2.1 GB
(the harness bypasses the trainer's VRAM pre-flight, so the 8 GB budget was
kept by hand). 68.99B params, 137.98 GB of bf16, one safetensors file per
layer, written to the second NVMe in **154.8 s**. Timing is real; values are
not, and nothing here is a correctness claim.

## 12. `shard_checkpoint` dies with an access violation at layer 61, twice

Both attempts (the probe's own sharding, then a bare re-shard under
`faulthandler`) wrote `layer_000..060` (26.9 GB) and then died with
**`Windows fatal exception: access violation`**, no Python traceback, exit 139,
no Event Log entry, no crash dump. `faulthandler` places it in
`torch/storage.py:480 __getitem__`, reached from `layer_shard._read_tensor`
line 1506 — i.e. inside `safe_open(...).get_tensor(key)`.

## 13. Reproduced without Kadhi, without CUDA, without bitsandbytes

`benchmarks/harness/mmap_limit_repro.py` (checked in): open the 80 layer
files with `safe_open`, call `get_tensor` on every key, keep nothing.

| pattern | result |
|---|---|
| one `ExitStack` holds ALL 80 handles open (the shipped sharder's pass-2 pattern) | **access violation after file 61 — 62 files, 106.1 GB of mappings, 26 s** |
| open / read / close each file in turn | **OK, all 80 files, 3 s** |

Three facts that narrow the cause:

- `get_tensor` is a **zero-copy view over the mmap** on this stack: it returns
  in 0.000 s, a repeat call returns the same `data_ptr`, and the first
  `.float().sum()` over a 470 MB tensor takes 0.588 s (0.8 GB/s — page faults
  through the mapping, not sequential reads); the second takes 0.045 s.
- The system commit limit is **36.7 GB** (31.7 GB RAM + a 5 GB page file), so
  the crash at ~106 GB is **not** copy-on-write commit exhaustion; read-only
  file mappings do not charge commit.

  > **WRONG — corrected 2026-09-13, and this bullet is why the mechanism
  > stayed unexplained. `safe_open` maps the file PRIVATELY, so mapping
  > charges commit for the file's whole size without touching physical
  > memory.** Measured by opening the 20-file fixture one file at a time,

  > (os error 1455)`, i.e. `ERROR_COMMITMENT_LIMIT`, on the second
  > `safe_open`. Same cause, reported properly because the allocation failed
  > at map time rather than at fault time.
- The per-file variant "read" 137 GB in 3 s, i.e. it read nothing: with no
  consumer touching the pages the views are free. The all-open variant spent
  0.42 s per file, which is the D: drive's sequential rate — so with 60+ live
  mappings the SAME calls were paging data in. What Windows does differently
  past ~60 concurrently mapped 1.7 GB sections is not established here.

**What is established:** the shipped sharder holds every source shard's
mapping open for the whole of pass 2 (`layer_shard.py:1262-1267`, one
`ExitStack`), and on Windows that pattern dies after ~62 files x 1.7 GB.
Every published sharding ran on checkpoints of 4 (8B) to ~37 (72B on Linux)
files; the Windows box never sharded more than 4. The fix shape is the
per-file pattern above: open the file a layer needs, read it, release it —
an LRU of one or two handles, since layers are contiguous in files. Whether
the limit is a COUNT of live mappings or their total BYTES decides whether a
real 30-file 70B checkpoint is affected; §14 tests that with the same bytes in
20 files.

## 14. Count or bytes: the same checkpoint in 20 files

The same 137.98 GB written again as 20 files of 4 layers (6.85 GB each),
second NVMe, 154 s. The all-open reader over it:

| files live | crashed after | bytes mapped at the crash |
|---|---|---|
| 80 x 1.71 GB | file 61 (62 files done) | **106.1 GB**, +1.7 GB in flight |
| 20 x 6.85 GB | file 13 (14 files done) | **95.8 GB**, +6.85 GB in flight |

**Finding 14 — it is bytes, not files: the box dies once ~96–103 GB of
safetensors mappings are alive in one process, at 14 handles or at 62.** A
real Llama-3.1-70B checkpoint is 30 files and ~141 GB, so the shipped sharder
cannot shard it on this OS; a 32B bf16 (~65 GB) is under the line and a 72B
is not. The threshold's mechanism is not established (commit is 36.7 GB, so
it is not commit; the reads are lazy views, so it is not resident memory);
its value is. Filed as #926 with this table.

**Corrected 2026-09-13: the mechanism IS commit**, and the parenthesis above
is wrong for the reason given in the §13 correction — mapping charges commit
privately, and the 36.7 GB limit it rules the theory out with is a limit that
grows. The bytes-not-files finding stands and is now explained: a private
mapping charges its file's SIZE, so what matters is the total mapped, at 14
handles or at 62.

## 15. The workaround used to get past it, and what it does NOT change

`stream_probe.py --lazy-shard-handles` replaces `safetensors.safe_open` for
the duration of `shard_checkpoint` ONLY with a wrapper that keeps at most two
real handles alive (least-recently-used release) and returns a copy from
`get_tensor` rather than the zero-copy view, because the sharder keeps
non-quantised tensors (norms, embeddings, the head) until it writes them and
a view over a released mapping is precisely the access violation above. The
sharder's own logic runs unchanged; the runtime (`DiskSource`, the pool, the
prefetcher) and every timed number below are the shipped code. The runtime
itself holds one handle per decoder layer for the whole run — 80 x 441 MB =
35 GB of mappings here, under the line; a 400B-class NF4 store would not be.

**Correction 2026-09-13, found while writing the fix (#926):** the reason
given above for the copy is wrong, and the copy is still needed. Measured
on this stack (safetensors 0.8.0, torch 2.14): a `get_tensor` view SURVIVES
its handle's `__exit__` — the tensor's storage owns the mapping, so a later
`get_tensor` on the closed handle raises `SafetensorError: File is closed`
while the earlier view still reads its bytes correctly. A released handle is
therefore not a use-after-unmap. It is the opposite problem: every retained
view keeps its whole file mapped, so an LRU of two handles alone would not
bound the live mappings; only tensors the sharder OWNS (a copy) release
them. The workaround did the right thing for the wrong reason, and the
sentence above is left as written.

What the retained view actually COSTS is now measured (the §13 correction):
a private mapping charges COMMIT for its whole file, so a view held past its
handle keeps ~6.85 GB of commit charged here in order to carry a 1.71 GB
tensor. Copying is cheaper than retaining, which is why the workaround's copy
was the right call even though its stated reason was not.

## 16. Sharding and build, with the workaround

| | |
|---|---|
| source | 20 files, 137.98 GB bf16, second NVMe |
| sharding | **216.9 s** — 138 GB in, **36.39 GB** NF4 out, one tensor at a time on the GPU |
| store | 0 GB resident (disk tier), 36.39 GB on disk: **larger than the 31.7 GB of RAM**, so no page cache can hold it |
| buffers | 2 x 441.4 MB decoder + one 536.9 MB large slot |
| build | 5.2 s |
| adapter | LoRA r=8 q/k/v/o on 80 layers |
| ceiling, this session | square 30.34 / shape-matched **31.43 TFLOPS** at M=512 |

## 17. The cold step

Batch 1, seq 512, 6 timed steps after 2 warm-up, uninstrumented:

| quantity | per step |
|---|---|
| step time (spread **93.6–158.1 s**) | **124.5 s** |
| throughput | **4.1 tok/s** |
| layer loads | 157 + 2 large (80 layers x 2 visits, minus the owned-slot skips) |
| bytes moved | **70.4 GB** |
| average source rate | **0.57 GB/s** |
| effective compute | 1.69 TFLOPS = **5% of the ceiling** |
| peak VRAM | **4.38 GB** allocated / 4.83 GB reserved (a 70B-shaped decoder trains inside 8 GB, as the arithmetic said) |
| SM clock at the end of the block | 210 MHz — the GPU is idling between layers |

**Finding 17 — the shipped disk tier, cold, is ~12x I/O-bound, and the
NVMe is not the reason.** The drive reads 3.5+ GB/s sequentially and there
are two of them; the run pulls **0.57 GB/s**, because `DiskSource.get` is a
synchronous `get_tensor` over a memory map, so every byte arrives through
4 KB page faults on the compute thread, one layer at a time, with the GPU
waiting. The arithmetic floor for the same step is ~10 s of compute (the
§18 ablation measures it); the other ~115 s is the read path. A source that
issued sequential, unbuffered reads on a background thread into pinned
staging would have ~6x the bandwidth at one drive and ~12x at two — and would
still need tokens-per-step (§9) to hide under compute. Both halves are needed
for a 70B on this laptop; neither exists in the shipped code.

The per-step spread (93.6 to 158.1 s) is the page cache's: with 17 GB free
around a 36 GB working set, which layers survive between steps is up to
Windows.

## 17a. The same step again, instrumented: a 6x spread, and a 22 MB/s floor

The second block (same shape, CUDA-event instrumentation on) did not
reproduce the first:

| block | steps, s | mean | source rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| uninstrumented | 123, 109, 150, 94, 113, 158 | **124 s** | 0.57 GB/s |
| instrumented | **3129**, 165, 199, 235, 393, 354 | 746 s | 0.094 GB/s |

The instrumentation is free on the RAM tier (§3) and costs nothing here
either — the bracket on the copy stream simply reports where the time went
(653.6 s of the 746 inside the read+copy path; compute-stream stall 1.4 ms).
What differs is the page cache. **One step took 3129 s: 70.4 GB at 22 MB/s**,
which is what a memory-mapped read degrades to when every page misses and
each miss is a synchronous 4 KB fault at queue depth 1 — random-read
territory on a drive that streams sequential reads at 3.5 GB/s. The other
steps sat between 165 and 393 s as some layers survived between visits.

**Finding 17a — on a store larger than RAM the shipped disk tier is not
merely slow, it is unstable by an order of magnitude from step to step**:
0.7 to 4.1 tok/s across two blocks of the same configuration, 22 MB/s to
0.57 GB/s at the source. Neither number is the NVMe's. The run was stopped
after these two blocks; a full A/B/C/D ablation at this pace would take
hours, so §18 measures only the arms that remove the read path.

## 18. The compute floor with the read path removed, and a card at its edge

Arms B (no source read, no copy) and D (B plus no dequantisation) only,
`--steps 3 --warmup 1`, same shape (batch 1, seq 512). Sharding was skipped
(the cache index now exists), build 5 s.

| arm | step | tok/s | effective |
|---|---|---|---|
| B no read, no copy | **39.8 s** | 12.9 | **5.3 TFLOPS** (17% of the 31.4 ceiling) |

That is not the compute floor the arithmetic predicts (~210 TFLOP per step at
the 7B's 20.6 TFLOPS effective would be ~10 s). Sampled during arm B:
`nvidia-smi` reported **7,620 of 8,151 MiB in use, 100% utilisation, 1.8 GHz,
40 W** — torch's own peak was 4.38 GB allocated / 4.83 GB reserved. A card
reporting full at 100% "utilisation" while drawing 40 W and delivering a
quarter of its measured rate is the WDDM spill signature the v0.72.3 and
v0.73.0 records describe: allocations past the card go to shared host memory
without an error and the run "merely" collapses. The likely driver here is the
#331 dequant-forward, whose dense transients for ONE 70B layer are 1.7 GB
(seven linears up to 470 MB each, alive inside the recomputed block), on top
of 0.88 GB of buffers, a 0.54 GB large slot, adapters and activations. The
harness bypasses the trainer's VRAM pre-flight, so nothing refused this shape;
§18a re-measures the floor at a shape that leaves headroom.

Arm D at seq 512, for the record: 67.2 s — slower than B, with the reported
clock falling 1965 -> 1462 MHz across the block. The card was at its memory
edge and, an hour into sustained load, evidently also at its thermal one
(67 °C and 1.7 GHz at idle afterwards); neither number at this shape is used
below.

## 18a. The floor at seq 256 and 128, with headroom

Same arms, `--steps 3 --warmup 1`, peak allocated 3.0–3.9 GB (the card is no
longer full), reported clock 1.07–1.86 GHz throughout.

| tokens | B: no read, no copy | D: B + no dequantisation | dequantisation = B − D |
|---|---|---|---|
| 256 | **14.25 s** / 18.0 tok/s / 7.4 TFLOPS | **6.73 s** / 38.0 tok/s / 15.7 TFLOPS | **7.5 s = 53% of B** |
| 128 | 14.46 s / 8.9 tok/s | 7.44 s / 17.2 tok/s | 7.0 s |

**Finding 18a — with the read path removed, a 70B-shaped step on this card
is ~14 s regardless of tokens, and half of it is the NF4 dequantisation.**
Dequantisation is paid per layer visit — 157 visits x 1.7 GB of dense bf16
written per step, 268 GB — so it does not shrink when the batch does; at
these token counts it is the same size as all the arithmetic put together.
The other half is also nearly flat between 128 and 256 tokens: the GEMMs at
M=128–256 read the 1.7 GB dense layer once per pass and are memory-bound, and
the ~160 per-visit launch/Python overheads (#841) come to seconds at this
depth where they came to a third of a second on 32 layers.

**What that means for "70B on this laptop", in numbers:** the shipped code's
step is ~14 s of dequant+compute plus 100–3100 s of read. A source that
streamed the 70 GB per step at the drive's sequential rate (3.5 GB/s, ~20 s;
two drives, ~10 s) would bring the step to ~25–35 s and ~10 tok/s at 256
tokens — worth having, and still 3x short of the floor, because the read
and the dequantisation are BOTH per-visit costs. Amortising visits over
several micro-batches (the L2L layer-major loop: load and dequantise a layer
once, run k micro-batches through it) divides both by k at the memory cost of
k sets of boundary activations. That, not a faster SSD alone, is what closes
the gap between "runs" and "usable" at this size.

## 19. Verdict, in one paragraph

On the RTX 5070 Laptop the RAM tier is still compute-bound at batch 1 x 512
(486 tok/s on a 7B NF4; stall 0.34%; deleting every H2D byte buys 6%), but
the copy stream is already 42% busy and the NF4 dequantisation is 23% of the
step, so #842 (fused dequant) is the first lever and #841 (per-visit fixed
cost) binds below ~200 tokens. The shipped disk tier is a different animal: a
synchronous memory-mapped read on the compute thread that costs 2.3x with the
whole store in the page cache and degrades to 22 MB/s–0.57 GB/s when it is
not, so a 70B-shaped model trains at 0.7–4 tok/s here while the same card,
with the read path removed, would do 18 tok/s (B) and 38 tok/s (D). The path
to a 70B on a laptop is therefore, in order: (1) an asynchronous source with
sequential unbuffered reads and pinned staging, off the compute thread, over
both NVMe drives; (2) layer-major micro-batching so each read AND each
dequantisation serves k micro-batches; (3) #842. And before any of that, the
sharder has to stop holding every source mapping open (§13–§14), or a real
70B checkpoint cannot be sharded on Windows at all.

## 20. What Section 3 did NOT measure

- **A real 70B.** Shapes and bytes are Llama-3.1-70B's decoder; the head is
  32k; the values are random. Nothing here is a correctness claim, and the
  bit-exactness gates were not run on the synthetic model.
- **The NVMe itself.** No block-level read test was run; 3.5 GB/s sequential
  is the drive's published figure, not measured here. The `--evict-gb`
  heuristic was not used (the store exceeds RAM, so cold is structural).
- **A/B/C/D at seq 512 with headroom**, and any arm A on the cold tier
  beyond the two step blocks — the run was stopped for time.
- **Thermal state.** The last blocks ran an hour into sustained load with
  reported clocks 1.0–1.9 GHz against 1.65–1.9 GHz at the start; the B/D
  ratios within one block are the defensible numbers, absolute rates less so.
- **The Windows mapping limit's mechanism** — only its value (~96–106 GB of
  live safetensors mappings) and its independence from file count.
