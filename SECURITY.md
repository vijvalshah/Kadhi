# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are shipped for the latest published release. We recommend always
running the most recent version from PyPI (`pip install -U kadhi-cli`).

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.75.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.75  | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** — do not open a public GitHub issue
for anything security-sensitive.

- Preferred: email **team@trykadhi.dev** (the project address), or
  **makazanalpamys@gmail.com** (the maintainer's personal address) if that bounces.
  Please do not report security issues in Discord — it is a public channel.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 5 business days and to ship a fix or
mitigation for confirmed, in-scope issues as promptly as is practical. When
reporting, please include:

- the affected version(s) and platform,
- a minimal reproduction or proof of concept,
- the impact you observed.

## Scope

Kadhi is a local-first CLI for fine-tuning LLMs. The threat model assumes the
operator runs Kadhi on their own machine with their own data. Representative
in-scope issues:

- path traversal or arbitrary file read/write from user-supplied config,
  dataset, or artifact paths;
- SSRF in the synthetic-data providers, inference server, or hub/endpoint
  validators;
- command, Modelfile, Jinja chat-template, or systemd/launchd unit injection;
- secret leakage in logs, crash bundles, or generated artifacts;
- sandbox escape in the RLVR code-execution reward path.

Out of scope:

- vulnerabilities in third-party model weights or datasets you choose to load;
- issues that require an already-compromised host;
- DNS and email configuration of `trykadhi.dev` — a missing or permissive
  DMARC / SPF / DKIM record, and anything else established by a public DNS
  query. These are worth fixing and we do fix them, but they are not findings
  in Kadhi and they are not eligible for anything.

### Telemetry and Network Egress

Kadhi is local-first. Telemetry is strictly **opt-in** (disabled by default) via `KADHI_TELEMETRY=1` and can be overridden per invocation with `--no-telemetry`. When enabled, telemetry transmits anonymous, hardware-only environment metadata (OS, architecture, Python version, command name sanitized against registered commands) via HTTPS. It never collects model weights, dataset contents, file paths, configurations, or secrets. See the [Privacy Policy](docs/backends-and-ops.md#privacy-policy) for complete details.

**There is no bug bounty and no monetary reward.** We credit reporters by name
in the release notes, which is the whole of what we offer. Reports that open
with a request for payment get this paragraph as the reply.

## Disclosure

We practice coordinated disclosure. Once a fix is released we credit the
reporter in the release notes, unless anonymity is requested.
